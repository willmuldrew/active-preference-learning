A couple days after she started shes been less happy, more tired, and completely pissed, at **me(20)** thou. She claims everything I do is wrong and always my fault.

She seems to **only attack me** with this anger and lately its so emotional it's making me want to leave but I do love her.

I'll Keep this short.

Years (YEARS) ago, in college, I was suspended for one semester, because of cheating. I was young, stupid, and STUPID. Happened once, and I reformed my ways.

OK now fast forward. Been married for about 5 years. We both respect each other immensely. I've never lied about my past to my wife, but I've never bothered telling her about my past transgression.

Anyway, lately, for some unknown reason, I've been thinking more and more to those years ago. I feel like I need to get this past history of mine OFF my chest to my wife. But I also know that it might be putting her through stress with no real reason (after all, whats the point of telling her? so I can feel better, at her expense?)

Okay, so I was in a relationship for 7 years (15-22) with someone. While we dated I put in all the effort, arranged fun dates and tried really hard to be the best gf I could be.

We notified the office manager after the movers left, as they didn't tell us about it. The manager was very nice and said he would document the incident and get back to us on Monday. The apartment manager is claiming that we are liable for the property damage, and need to get reimbursed by the charity on our own time.

We're moving out in a few weeks. What's the right approach here? Is it up to the apartment manager to work with the charity that did the damage directly? Or are they correct that we need to pay for the damage and then seek reimbursement?

We're moving out soon. Are they allowed to take this out of our security deposit?

Anyway, we're in a not-quite-long-distance relationship--he lives an hour away and drives to see me once a week.

TITLE: Why do I [22f] keep dreaming about cheating on my boyfriend [24m]?
POST: For the past month or so, I have been having vivid dreams nearly every single night. These dreams almost *always* involve me at least kissing, and sometimes banging, a dude who isn't my boyfriend. Sometimes it's someone I actually know, other times I've never seen him before. The dream always ends with me waking up in a moment of panic, thinking ""oh my gosh, what have I done?!"" until a few seconds later when it sinks in that it was just a dream and I didn't actually cheat on my perfect, wonderful boyfriend.

I don't understand where this is stemming from. I'm an incredibly faithful woman and I would never dream (well, figuratively I guess) of cheating on my boyfriend. I love him and he completely satisfies me sexually, although I only get to see him once a month or so because we're long distance.

He is always shouting ""Are you serious?! Oh my god!  That's a fucking red, ref!"" and stuff like that.  He bangs his table sometimes.  And he's just watching soccer alone.  It would be less unusual to me if he were sharing it with his friends and they were all getting riled up.  But it is just him on his laptop, yelling at his laptop.  Or when he plays FIFA, he'll say the same stuff.

I normally just don't say anything.  When I first moved in, I would ask if he was okay when he would do this, and he would just say yeah.  It is kind of annoying but I don't know what I can do about it.

TITLE: Cold? Too bad, I'm in charge of the thermostat from now on.
POST: I work at a dr's office in a building with other tenants.  We have three thermostats.  One of our exam rooms gets particularly cold, it happens to also be the room we do pap smears in.  Whenever my coworker, Maria, notices she has a pap (we don't do them often) she turns the thermostat to 78*.  We are in south Texas, it's hot and humid.  78* makes the entire nurses station and 4 other exam rooms hot and gross.  The building maintenance came in on Friday to check our air flow, they were getting a complaint that one of the offices (newly leased) was too hot.  Turns out that our back thermostat also controls that office.  I told Maria that maintenance said not to touch the thermostat.  I get to keep it at 70-72* without the whole back office getting hot.

I plan on losing my weight by limiting myself to 2,000 calories and doing 8 5 minute workouts everyday. On my days off I plan on working on cardio but at work I thought, what the heck. Why not use the downtime to trim my belly.

All I could think about doing is push-ups and sit-ups. And trust me I dont want a lecture on why doing 100 push ups a day would be a bad idea, so help me mix it up a bit. 

I will dedicate 5 minutes of every work hour to do each set.

TITLE: I know the Nazis were terrible and all but...
POST: I know the Nazis were terrible and all but how do they compare to other occupying military's through history? Sometimes I feel like we have been encouraged to hate them for obvious reasons. But at the same time I wonder how brutal they are compared to other regimes.

I think to fairly compare them we should only look at the 'normal soldiers.' From what I heard the SS is mostly responsible for carrying out the Holocaust. Yet in movies and pop culture it seems like regardless of what kind of infantry/soldier/position the German guy is in he's always raping and pillaging.

POST: I really like a girl who has been in multiple classes that we both have seemed to enjoy. I have barely talked to her, most recently to ask about some homework. I want to get her phone number and talk with her more, but I am not sure on how I should do this. I get nervous whenever I think about going over to talk with her and I'm unsure on what exactly to say.

Whenever I speak with other girls I don't feel so nervous, but with her I do. Is it best for me to just walk up to her and admit to finding her attractive and ask for her number? Or is it better for me to just ask her casually? Thanks for any help!

POST: Had a pretty crappy breakup, she dumped me. Handled it badly, went semi- no contact except for maybe a very minor message or something every 6 weeks or so. Hadn't spoken for like 2 months before her birthday two days ago, where I had planned to call just for like 30 seconds. She didn't answer, gave a one word reply to my ""hey just wanted to call and say happy birthday"" etc message. Messaged me each day since, haven't replied to any. I don't want to reply, the only conversation I want to have with her is the reconciliation one but I don't think that's going to happen nor do I think it's what she's doing now. She's doing the how've you been etc.

I'm doubting myself a bit here, I want to just ignore it like I have been, right move?

Thanks guys.

TITLE: Auto loan interest rate is way high, but i make enough to double down monthly payments
POST: So i bought a nice used car for 11.5k+ tax (2009 Accord coupe v6) And they gave me a high interest rate (7.19) for being a young male. I put 3k down so  I'm close to 9k left. my monthly for 48 months is $269 with Ally. I tried paying $100 extra a month but those con artists are not applying the whole amount to the principal! My first extra payment only 60 bucks went into the extra principal. the next like 80 went in. the rest is being applied to the finance charge.... I've called multiple times to tell them the WHOLE payment needs to be applied. they tell me because finance charge is calculated daily it gets taken out of my monthly payment. the rep told me to add my extra $100 to the monthly statement thats due near the end of the month. Is that good advice?

i was wearing flip-flops today. and anyone who has worn them knows that going down stairs can be a noisy process if you're not careful about it. i chose not to be careful. i made sure my shoes slapped against each and every step on that landing. it echoed against the walls. it was a beautiful thing.

TITLE: My girlfriend[21F] of 8 months wants me[21M] to consign for her new car
POST: So I've been dating my gf for about 8 months now. Everything is great so far except for the fact that she is extremely irresponsible with money. She already has a crazy amount of debt for school, bank loans, and pretty bad credit, not to mention very little in savings because the second she gets her paycheck she spends it all. She wants to finance a new car and wants me to cosign because I have decent credit. I told her no because based on her inability to pay bills on time and actually save any money, consigning would be a very bad financial investment for me. She keeps nagging me to cosign, almost like she won't take no for an answer. I also figured (didn't say this to her) that if we break up in the future I wouldn't want my name/SSN/credit to be linked back to her. Am I wrong for not wanting to cosign?

Furthermore, she didn't send ALL the gifts I gave to her, just, I guess, the ones she didn't want.

Is she trying to make me feel even worse? Does she not understand breakup etiquette? Do I not understand it? Am I missing something here? Am I warranted in feeling so insulted or am I just looking for something to be mad about because I'm so hurt by the breakup itself?
