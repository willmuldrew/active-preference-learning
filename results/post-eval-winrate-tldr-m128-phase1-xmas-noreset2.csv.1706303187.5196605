POST: Location: Sacramento, California, US

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

A week ago the e-mail saying ""hi, how are you."" Leads to the exchanging of phone numbers etc. After having a couple of conversations with her I realize I want no part of being with her. 

However I do still enjoy her company. What I need from you all is to tell me how exactly you would go about putting a EX-SO in the friend zone. 
Help me out here people, I can't date her; WON'T date her. But I want her in my life. Make me some magic internet.

Hi. I've been on Citalopram (Celexa) since May. 20 mg. For anxiety. I've been a student in Germany since 2009. Last month when I flew back home to India for a holiday, my doctor there replenished my medication stock for me. But he gave me a 6 month supply of Escitalopram (Lexapro) instead of Citalopram.

Today I finished my previous stock of Citalopram. Unfortunately, my doctor here near my flat is on holiday, tomorrow is All Souls Day which is a holiday too. The next appointment I can get is probably next week. Is it okay to switch to Lexapro? I mean, I have no other choice as of now.

POST: I'm a sophomore at college, 6 hours away from school.
Started dating this girl my senior of high school. She commutes to school. We did well with video chatting and all my freshman year. She broke up with me in July, and we stopped talking until mid September. I went back home a few weeks ago and met back up with her. Had a great time. We agreed we can't be together because it just won't work at the moment, but we'll maintain a friendship and keep talking through our college years to see if things can work out after college.

POST: I've gone out on 3 dates with a girl I really like. Out of the blue, she texts me that it's not gonna work out for her. She said that I'm a nice guy and she doesn't wanna lead me on/hurt me (she says she's done it to others before). That she's realized it's not gonna go anywhere for her and she can't commit to things. I haven't brought up commitment, seeing as we have only gone on 3 dates, so this threw me off. 

Everything seemed to be going so well, which is why I'm having a hard time accepting this. When get back to school from winter break I want to meet up with her and just talk. I can't tell if she's legit (in which case I'd like like to try and fix things) or if she's just trying to spare my feelings. I know it's just been 3 dates but I really like this girl.

POST: I met this girl around 10 years ago and have liked (maybe even loved) her ever since. She has almost always had a boyfriend and we've always been good friends. We would hang out often and I've come close to telling her how I feel a few times.

I often think of her and recently I decided to text her and see how she was doing. We texted back and forth for a couple of days, mainly small talk. She's doing well and has another boyfriend, etc. so my question is should I just tell her how I feel? Would it even have any meaning now?

Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

*Charles Schwab 2055 (SWORX) Net Expense Ration 0.73% / YTD Earnings 2.97%
 

*Vanguard 2055 (VFFVX) Fees & Expenses 0.18% / YTD Earnings 6.95%

POST: My boyfriend is absolutely amazing at everything that he does. He's a wonderful person and I can confidently say he's my best friend. Roughly three months ago, he moved about 1k miles away (work related). We talk daily (even if it's brief, one of us manages to call) and I've visited once. Gradually (pre-move) he became less focused on me and more so on the move. I couldn't expect anything less. Lately, it seems like environmental factors have been influencing him more frequently (forgets to call me back, fewer intimate conversations, ect.). He's easily distracted, and generally a reserved person. What can I do to help him open up to me without being overbearing?

She's not the best at expressing herself emotionally like if I tease by saying I'm gonna leave or walk ahead she'll grab my arm and say ""no.."" (neither of us are 12 but this kind of behavior isn't the best reminder). My question is if we're actually dating or in a relationship even though she's not comfortable talking about it or setting rules in a direct way. It's really easy for me to get intimate, everytime we greet I hug her and we kiss for a little less than a minute and do the same when I walk her home.

TITLE: 18M Need advice on asking a girl out, or maybe even if I should
POST: So there's a girl (I'm in high school) I've been talking to for a while who's pretty unique. Usually I can get a decent read on a person's character and personality, but not with her. She just seems to operate differently and it makes me a little bit self conscious about things I would normally consider automatic signals of interest. She snapchats me, messages, or texts me on a daily basis, and she went to prom with me but we never asserted whether it was as friends or not, she hasn't ""friendzoned"" me yet, and so I've decided just to ask her out. I was wondering if you could give me advice on the situation? What's a good first date idea that is casual enough to have no pressure but cute enough to be obviously a date? Is it possible she thinks nothing of the amount of time we spend talking?

TITLE: Valentine's Day, gift idea?
POST: Hello Reddit!
I was wondering if some of you could help me.

Besides getting tickets to a sold out show of her favorite band (both 21 years old, we decided to not do the whole ""go out for dinner, etc"" for Valentine's Day) I want to give her something else as well.

My girlfriend really likes this poem that's in a book I gave to her (if you're interested, it's the poem that's in ""The Perks Of Being A Wallflower"") I was thinking of printing the poem and to put it in a nice frame or something, though it's not exactly original/exciting, so I was wondering if anyone could come up with a potential better idea?

The problem is he does not even own the copyright. I certainly don't either but the entire movie is on youtube and my clip actually got featured on Ray William Johnson's show and obviously youtube isn't going to remove that.

TITLE: How do I [25 F] get my boyfriend [27 M] to get a job?
POST: Here's the situation:

I've been dating him for over a year now and recently he has decided to go back to college. However, due to poor financial decisions in the past, he has no money, no job, and doesn't really actively seek a job.

Instead, I'm paying for almost everything for him and it's frustrating because I just got a full time, salaried position, and I can't even enjoy the money I'm making because I have to save money to pay for things like his car payments and gas money. He doesn't have his own place and just crashes at his friend's. The problem is that I'm too nice to cut him off and every time I push him to get a job by reminding him of all the things I'm paying for, he turns it on me and accuses me of ""keeping track"", which I am not.

Have any of you ever been in a similar situation, what is the best way to approach this?

We are going to go through marriage counseling weekly at least.  During that period, we are entertaining her moving out to a nearby apartment while I stay in the home.  We will still be married and committed to each other, just not living together.  Is this a normal thing to do?  Is this a good thing to do?  Or would that just be the start of the end?

TITLE: Lake Michigan Credit Union/Rewards checking accounts
POST: I'm currently with Ally bank and their.84% interest rate is nice, but I just found out about reward checking accounts with LMCU offering 3% interest if certain demands are met: direct deposit, 10 debit card transactions, 4 logins to home banking, and electronic billing statements. These are all things that I do anyway, except for 4 home logins a month which is quite doable. Have any of you tried this/ does it sound enticing?

As it is a credit union it is insured by the NCUA, does this all sound too good to be true? Is there a catch I'm missing?

We figured people spend thousands for this kind of destination wedding so it makes sense for us to have a small one here and when we move back mainland in a few years have another bigger ceremony for friends and family. 

Does anyone have recommendations for sites to help organize this chaos?  Would it be rude to not have a reception and just ask the island friends to join us at Dave & Busters for drinks and games?

TITLE: Gf (18) and I (18) are scared religion may come between us.
POST: (We've been together for almost a year). We've been in a long distance relationship since the start of this school year and things have been going even better than we had expected. Her school has a very active Jewish community while mine is much smaller. She has been actively Jewish her entire life and has become even more so at school. I was raised a similar way and have also become more active, just not to the same degree. We're both afraid that our differing degrees of observance will come between us in the long run, even though we have each on separate occasions expressed our concerns and that we want to make it work. Should I be concerned? Is there anyone else who has had a similar experience with advice? Thanks!

He was having a rough time remembering which phone number he used for his ""club card"" to get the savings  and normally when people say they don't have one or they can't remember it, I'll just tell them mine so they can save the couple dollars. Not this time, asshole.

POST: We've been together for 2 year, and in the beginning we would have sex alllll the time-- like 2 to 3 times a day, every day. It was great. Nowadays, we have sex maybe once every 1-2 weeks. I just don't have the drive to have sex. I've tried to spice things up with toys and games, and they work sometimes but I just seem to have lost all drive. I still find him attractive, but I'm always tired and never in the mood (I'd rather watch TV or sleep, etc.). Anyone who has been in a long relationship before, did you experience this? Did it pass? Is it something that I am going to have to work at all the time? 

My theories as to why are either:
- It's typical with relationships this long, and it will pass.
- It's my birth control, and it's ruining my sex drive.

TITLE: PSA: Buying a kid's bike isn't just about the wheel size.
POST: I thought the wheel size was the only measurement that mattered.

Learned the hard way that's not the case.

No one ever talks about ""crank arm length"" -- the length of the arms that the pedals are connected to. And the length is pretty damn important. They are generally measured in millimeters, and the 170mm crank arms that came on my kid's 20"" bike are as long as those on my adult bike. (Apparently this is a thing on BMX bikes, this bike wasn't clearly billed as such)

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

Trying to find replacements, but these aren't parts generally designed to be replaced on cheap bikes. So now it's one of those situations where attempting to save money is probably going to cost more money.

Now, I don't demand much in the area of texting. Once a day before bed, a quick ""I love you."" We used to talk all the time, he was like my best friend. Now... I'm lucky to even get a text between all his video games and stuff. We see each other at school for maybe 10 minutes tops. He claims ""there's nothing to talk about"".

I don't know how to respond. I think about him constantly. He said hes sorry and that he loves me, I don't doubt that. I just don't know where to go from here.

One day, I had a bleeding nose and went to get a tissue. She hit me with the cane for bleeding in class and I never got that tissue. Now I'm a waitress in a restaurant and Mrs Jackass steps in to order some Steak with Chips. I took down her order and went on to get this really old and musty steak. I asked the cook to cook it and he did. She was about eighty and recognised me after a few minutes. She gives me ""the stare"" as I hand over her food.

Two months ago I filled out a loan agreement with someone in the amount of $10,000 plus interest for a period of a month. The agreement was notarized saying that the borrower was to pay me back in a month. Well now they are past due 3 weeks entering the 4th.

Do I notify him that I have a demand letter ready one last time to see if he cooperates or do I just send the letter via UPS or FedEx already? 

He is a paralegal so I would think he has an idea how things work. Being that the small claims limit is $10k how can I sue him for the amount plus interest if it is over the limit?

In less than a month, I'm turning eighteen.

I've always been that person that never celebrated his own birthday. This is because I didn't really have any friends until I got out of middle school and because I always thought my parents were embarassing.

I do have some friends now, and I've been invited to several 18th birthday parties myself. However, I still do not  really want to celebrate my birthday. The house I'm living in is a mess and I wouldn't even know what to do or prepare for such a party.

I've been talking to this girl for roughly two weeks now and we've gone on a handful of dates. If I had to describe the feeling, I'd say it's overwhelming. Overwhelming because I've never clicked/felt this strongly about anyone before and it's scary in a way.

If we're being honest, I feel like she is the one. But that's a conversation for another day.

Anyways, it's obvious we are both very into each other. She has sent me sweet texts saying how much she can't wait to see me again in between dates and we are both very comfortable with each other.

Now, since I like her so much and everything is going so well right now, my biggest fear is messing things up. Obviously I want to be official and have a real relationship with her, but I don't want to ""move too fast"" or rush things if that makes sense.

My job pays me well so I have reasonable financial resources. I create my own schedule at work so my time is fairly flexible. Give me ideas - anything I can do on either a daily, weekly, or monthly basis (but something that doesn't interfere too much with my daily life; e.g. I can't move to a different state or country).

POST: i am a high school student, and i was surfing reddit the other day. i am fairly new to this site so i don't know every single sub-reddit, but my friend told me about the ever so fucked up r/jailbait so being foolish i went there. i was creeped out, even though the girls are my age. but i saw one photo, and it was a facebook photo of a girl that goes to my school. she is 16 and therefore under age. I found the original poster but it was just their porn account. he posted several other photos of her. I don't know if he had her permission, but i doubt it. for the record, i don't exaggerate when i say she is widely believed to be the hottest girl in our grade, and possibly the school. i am a boy who has never spoken to her and i don't want to sound creepy by saying, ""oh hey hottest girl at school, i saw some photos of you in a bikini on a porn site! maybe you should do something"". what should i do?

TITLE: Do you have a book that you love, but are embarrassed to talk about?
POST: 2016 is the year of diversifying my reading life. What does this mean? Great question, I don't really know. At the end of last year I realized that I had read a lot of books (112 to be exact) but there wasn't much variety going on, I almost exclusively read history and literary fiction. I decided that was bonkers, and that I needed to expand my horizons. 

As part of this, I picked up Outlander by Diana Gabaldon as a romance pick and I thought it was AMAZING. I realized that I didn't want to talk about it to the group of friends that I usually talk to about books, because I was kind of embarrassed to have loved a ""romance"" book so much (about 2 days later I got over it and talked their ears off about it). 

I was wondering if anyone else had been in the situation where you loved a book but were to embarrassed to admit it?

POST: Thank you so much everyone! During my process of seeing things from a different view I sometimes come across an issue that I still see ""the old way"" and need help to see it differently. I just got off the phone with the prettiest woman in the world and told her about my epiphany - thanks to you all. It basically boils down to the fact that I would rather preserve her persona and who she really is rather than preserve her body the way I want to. She is amazing and very patient with me through this process and it made her very happy to hear my new view of things. She decided to wait until I get there to get it so that I can be there by her side and we will have that positive connection to the tattoo. That, and I may get one of my own!

You are all amazing, thank you again so much for your insight!

TITLE: Does having the same ""level of intelligence"" make a date more successful?
POST: 18f here, and I've been talking to a guy who is 19. I go to a really good university and I'm studying Physics. We met about 2 months ago and he texts me a lot. We're supposed to hang out when I go back for second semester.

Here's the problem: He's not smart. He's almost at the point where I'd call him stupid. It sounds awful, but it's true. However, he's incredibly nice and charming. We have stuff in common such as skiing/snowboarding and other outdoorsy things but I'm worried that we'll have nothing to talk about besides that. I've always been friends with smart kids (nerds, basically). Does anyone have any insight into whether this sort of match generally works out? I don't want to waste his time or mine and I don't want to lead him on if there's no hope.

TITLE: Question about returning back to university.
POST: Signed up a few weeks ago. This is my first post. 

I (F23) attended a university for 4 years, yet never graduated. Mental, emotional, and physical stress towards the end of my senior year caused me to not return to classes. I never officially withdrew from the university, just never signed up for next semester. I proceeded to pretend I was a university graduate, but without a piece of paper to back me up.  

Am wondering if any other people are in the same boat as I am; I'm feeling really lost and hopeless. I want to return and finish what I started and worked so hard for, yet came up short. I feel like I'm being left behind while all my other friends are getting well paid jobs. Feeling like a poser.

POST: So my old roommate tries to hangout with me and my new roommates every weekend. At first I tried to tell my roommates not to let him come but they thought I was being irrational. Now he feels like he is part of the group and we all want him out. He used to invite himself over all the time and we finally got him to stop doing that. But we don't want him to be around anymore. I told my roommates the only way to deal with it is to just straight up tell him that we don't want to hang out with him anymore, but we don't know how to go about it without saying it outright. What is the best way to handle this situation? 

BTW- he is an alcoholic so we want to let him down easy so he doesn't go crazy with alcohol.
