TITLE: Naive young man having lady problems
POST: Hi guys,

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

What should I do now?

POST: Hey Reddit, 

Need some advice. So this girl at work just started at her new position 2 days ago, today small talk with her ended up hanging out in her cubicle for a good amount of time just conversing  (we hit it off pretty good, her being 25, and me being 23, one of the youngest people at the office). Now the hard part, I got her number and all and I'm wondering how can I address to a girl that I'm trying to be more than friends (not trying to be in the friendzone)? Like how long should I wait to make my intentions clear? I haven't been in a committed relationship for almost 3 years, so I'm pretty rusty in the dating game and what not. Any input would be appreciated! For what it's worth her body language was very compliant, she was twirling her hair, and laughing at all my jokes, and she seems very welcoming, and she's down to hangout

POST: Hey guys

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?

TITLE: Fifth Third is holding my car hostage what can I do?
POST: Sorry...kinda long backstory. I recently bought a new, used, car. Unfortunately, the person I bought the car from had taken out a loan on the vehicle from Fifth Third. I paid him with a cashiers check (Supposedly as good as cash) and he went to the bank to pay off the loan. That is where the trouble started. Fifth Third said that since he was not paying off in cash they could not sign off on the title until Tuesday, which was the next business day. That's fine no big deal. So I go back to the bank today (Wednesday) to have them sign off on the loan and now they are saying it's a two week wait. Apparently since the loan was not paid off in cash they have a 2 week window. What can I do?? Fifth Third has the money and yet no one can drive the car.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

But, the hat that arrived at my house was red. I followed zazzle's instructions for requesting an exchange. To be honest, I didn't even think I would be able to get an exchange because the receipt said I ordered a red one... yeah I might have accidentally ordered a red one. But I requested the exchange for the white hat, and zazzle customer service responded the next day. They were extremely apologetic and said that no exchange was necessary. They said I was free to do with the red hat as I wished. Keep it, sell it, discard it, whatever. And they would send me the white hat I wanted at no extra cost. This, friends, gave me faith in humanity.

Because of the size of the stations and going from bus to subway or subway to train, there is quite a distance to walk and I want to cover it quickly.

Now, I'm fairly tall compared to most people in this country and hence I walk with a large stride. I also walk quite quickly (much to my wife's annoyance haha).

But what irks me to the upmost is when these little people with their short legs cut me off and walk slowly in front of me, especially when talking loudly (they are like macaws here) to their friends or on the phone.

However, I am finding it really hard to surrender to these desires because he has a really close female friend. As a person I am pretty confident and do not get jealous easily..

He reassures me and tell me they are just friends and I shouldnt worry about it. Am I being a fool?

Well, apparently I'm not. I'm just on the spectrum. I'm not having a hard time accepting it, because on some level I've always known. 

When I told my family, my dad asked what it meant - so I explained it to the best of my abilities.

I just laughed it off initially, but it actually hurt my feelings a lot.

I turned and saw a frail old man who must have been in his 90s standing in the doorway of his house. I walked over and he asked if I could help him with something. I said I would help, so I followed him to a step-ladder in his kitchen. He said that he needed to change the bulb but he couldn't get up the ladder. 

After I changed the bulb, he said that he'd give me something for helping out. He reached for a small tray of change on his kitchen table and picked out the only 50p coin in his tray of 1p and 2p coins. I told him he didn't have to give me anything but he said that it was only right to reward helping out an old man.

In response, she told me she didn't feel the same anymore, and she just wanted to be friends.

She had started to become distant weeks before, and I knew it wasn't working... Anyway, several days ago, she sent me a email, asking to talk on Skype. So I accepted, and the next day we talk. All she wanted to do was have small talk. I was fairly offended, and cut her off, and logged off. At this point, I'm not really sure what I should do next.

TITLE: How can I become a consistent planner and a hard-worker?
POST: I am a huge procrastinator and a half-ass-er (is that a word?).  I procrastinate on just about anything that requires the most minuscule amount of work, and always try to find the easy way out of everything (as in, if a task requires a lot of effort, I'll either half-ass-it, take an easier, more crappier route to doing it, or just give up).  

This has obviously negatively affected my life in a bunch of ways, and frankly, I'm tired of it.

Not knowing if it will fly away and get lost in my house somewhere I quickly used my sock to grab it and take it outside. When I get outside it gets stuck inside my sock, it has several small barbs on its legs, which was the pricking i felt, finally get it out of my sock and put a glass over it. Now im trying to figure out what it is, in the 10 years I have been camping at the same place I have never seen it before. So Reddit, WTF is this thing?

TITLE: [M26] how to express feelings to a friend?
POST: Hey Reddit, Ive got a questions about the best way to express feelings to a good friend of mine.  

Basically my friend [F26] is recently single, Ive known her for four years and realized I had feelings for her about 6 months ago.  I haven't expressed much interest as she has been with someone and I wanted to respect that.  Now that shes single I would like to at least let her know that I have some feelings for her (I missed my chance before she began dating her latest BF).  I may loose her as a friend but if I dont tell her I feel that Ill regret it. 

I'm not a shy person, and I'm not socially awkward, I just have trouble letting my feelings known (its caused some regret in the past).  So my question is this, for those that have been in this situation before how do you recommend doing it?

She said yes, as I sat next to her. I copied the notes and in my stupidity I didn't say anything. I rushed to copy them, and it took about 2 minutes. I hand that papers back and say, ""Thank you ___. I'll see you around.""

Yesterday I decided to propose the idea of dating after prom. She tells me that she isn't really interested in me like that, likes me as a friend, yadda, yadda, yadda, you know the story. The ""friendzone"" as it is not-so-affectionately named. 

Any advice on what I should do from here? The dance is coming up on Friday, so any advice relevant to that would be great, but I'd appreciate general advice as well.

Her parents are also divorced and been through many dads, has been bullied a bit and abused. Perhaps it's easy for me because she's the first girl I've ever loved. But she feels bad for not explaining it to me (I told her to not worry about it, she doesn't have to explain anything, i can't force her feelings).

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again.

POST: Me and my girlfriend have been living together for a while but since a while we are apart from eachother again. 
Atm we are not together but speak daily on whatsapp. 
She uses my fb account to see on her friends/families posts. But i have found out that she is checking daily a friends profile [20] (pictures of him). They know eachother like 1 year.

I once jokily asked if she liked him but she said ofcourse not. She sees him every weekend when working together. I know she wouldn´t cheat on me, but the fact she lies to me hurts me. I dont want to be controlling her and i never did, but the fact i noticed this now makes me do it anyway. 

She is still normal to me and she didnt changed her behavior alot. She started checking on him since im gone.

Squeaky has been alone for about 12 years (I had adopted two cats, but the other one was bat-shit crazy and wouldn't stop spraying my house, unnecessary factoid,) and I'm not sure how he'll take it.

I've read a lot, a LOT! about introducing new cats, but would love some input from you folks about introducing a new cat to a really well settled in cat.

If it matters, I'll most likely get an older cat as I appreciate their mellow demeanor.

We hung out a couple of times but after she told me she liked someone else we started to drift apart. A couple weeks ago we started talking again. I asked her out over text and she told me that she was flattered but she had broken up with her bf about 2 weeks ago. She told me she would keep my offer in mind when she was ready to date again. She finished off by saying "" I'm just not into the whole dating thing yet"" I told her I was sorry to hear that and that she should take all the time she needs.

* My wedding is March in Key West (yay!). The weather should be mild (70s-80s). Weather permitting, the event will take place outside in the gardens of a historic home. I'm want the affair to feel like Kate Spade Garden Dinner Party - classic, but fun. Main color is navy with accents of green, pink, and metallics. 

* My first instinct was to put the girls in long dresses but the choices are less fun. Since this is a garden wedding in a tropical place, I don't want them to look overdone (or want the girls to be uncomfortable!). I found some shorter dresses that I LOVE but I'm unsure if my mixing and matching works or not.

Neither of us were interested in having an affair but after another month we started spending a lot of time together.  Eventually she felt that we should have some space from each other, which I reluctantly agreed with.  Looking back now I see that it was the right decision but at the time it really hurt.

So I guess what I'm really asking here is, how should one deal with overattachment? I don't expect there's a simple fix, but is there any sort of wonderful advice I could send her way? I'd appreciate it.

Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this.

POST: Hey Reddit, 

Need some advice. So this girl at work just started at her new position 2 days ago, today small talk with her ended up hanging out in her cubicle for a good amount of time just conversing  (we hit it off pretty good, her being 25, and me being 23, one of the youngest people at the office). Now the hard part, I got her number and all and I'm wondering how can I address to a girl that I'm trying to be more than friends (not trying to be in the friendzone)? Like how long should I wait to make my intentions clear? I haven't been in a committed relationship for almost 3 years, so I'm pretty rusty in the dating game and what not. Any input would be appreciated! For what it's worth her body language was very compliant, she was twirling her hair, and laughing at all my jokes, and she seems very welcoming, and she's down to hangout

It's pretty sad, maybe the reality of life is just hitting me, or maybe I attract the wrong kinds of people.  I'm a very giving caring person.  I don't feel like I get taken advantage exactly, but I do notice that I am ALWAYS there when various friends need me, but the reality is they aren't always there for me.

I do have a couple old friends that I consider very good friends, they have yet to disappoint, and are a pleasure to know, however I rarely see them.

POST: am an unlicensed Paralegal Graduate located in Toronto,ON.

I was recently contacted by someone who wants me to look over a civil case they are a part of.

""Duty is to respond back to civil suit that was filed through the superior court of justice. To examine case, and to respond back with all necessary paperwork.""

Thats what it said on the ad.

He wants me to look over the case pull up forms he needs to fill out and I guess file them for him.

Now my question is am I breaking any rules or regulations by helping him fill out forms? I know as an unlicensed paralegal I can't give him any legal advice and I made that clear to him but is there anything else I should be aware of?

TITLE: Me [25F] with my SO [27 M] of 3.5 years, I went through his texts and can't stop thinking about something I saw.
POST: I admit that going through his text messages was wrong and I do feel incredibly guilty about it now but the bigger issue for me is that I found something that I can't stop thinking about. He was talking to his good female friend and I saw a text that said ""am I being an idiot for leaving [my name]""?. I stopped reading after that because I started having a panic attack. The idea of breaking up was not even on my radar and I thought he was more than happy. Again, I know I shouldn't have looked but whats done is done and now I can't stop worrying about when it's going to happen. And now i'm being clingy just because of my worry which i'm sure doesn't help. I love him and don't want to lose him.

TITLE: My (16F) Mom (42F) blamed me for her failed marriage. Now she's trying to talk to me again.
POST: Background info: My parents (42F and 50M) are divorced. I live with my dad full time. 

Mom and I got into a heated argument about college. She claimed she didn't have the money to have me and my 3 sisters in college at the same time. My mom makes good money, she's a surgeon and my dad's a well respected and busy lawyer. I got really heated & careless and said that I didn't ask to be born and maybe she should've been more responsible with birth control. She then said that she and my dad only got married because of me and I'm the reason for her failed marriage. 

I believe her because it makes sense. My older sister (19) has a different dad than me. I was at my parents wedding when I was 6 months old. 

I haven't spoken to my mom since but I heard from my dad she wants to talk to me. What do I do? I'm incredibly angry and hurt.

POST: I somehow met an amazing girl via Facebook about a year ago and we hit it off amazingly well and have been messaging eachother daily for the whole time.

Recently, we've started going out together (took so long because we were both super shy [still kinda are but comfortable around eachother]) and our messages have started sounding more and more couple-ish. 
I want to bring up what exactly we are or how she feels about me but I have no idea how to do this.
The only experience I have is ""wna b my gf? kl"" when I was like 11.

POST: I'm in my final year of college now and I have run into a problem. I've moved to a new school and I've had no problem fitting in but, I have a main group of friends that I play in the top rugby team with and the first game of the season is on Saturday 2nd of May. This is a problem as 2 months ago I put my name forward for a one-off 48 hour film festival with a different group of friends, that that goes non-stop from May 1st 7pm - May 3rd 7pm. Both are on at the same time and I am unsure about what I should do about it. 

Rugby: If I miss this game I lose my starting position in the team and I don't want to let the team down (we have been training for 8 weeks.

Film festival: I said I would do it first week of new school and one guy has had to pull out due to a unexpected medical issue and we have all put in a registration bond so I don't want to pull out as they might have to pull out.
