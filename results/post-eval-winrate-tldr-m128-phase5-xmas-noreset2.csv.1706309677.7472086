POST: I will try to make this brief and please be gentle.
My exgf cheated on me over the holidays and I kicked her out and told her not to contact me. We haven't had contact since this happened. When we started dating she told me she was forced to give up her horse and would like to know if she is still alive. Every time anything that has to do with a horse she gets emotional.  Being the nice bf I am, I started to look for her horse. fast forward to yesterday: I received an email asking if this was the horse I was looking for. After an hour long Q&A it turns out it was her horse. Do I give this information to her or not?

The weird part is I was so sure I wanted a relationship, but since we started dating suddenly I am not so sure.  I feel myself almost wanting other girls even more badly now (sort of a want-what-you-can't-have type of thing).  

I'm not sure if this is a normal reaction to a first relationship or maybe I thought I was more ready and mature then I actually am.  Any thoughts?

(We haven't had sex or done anything past 2nd base so could it be sexual frustration?)

TITLE: Is this a good plan?
POST: Hey guys, I posted awhile back about which Astronomy school I should try to go for and I need to know if this is a good plan that I've laid out.

I'm going to go to CC for a year or two because the tuition is so cheap and my job will pay for most of it, (Chipotle is a great company), and after that shop around the schools in Ohio that have the best Physics program for the best price. I've heard that where you get your undergrad means pretty much nothing to anyone and grad school is where it really counts.

I'm not trying to plan ahead to what school I'm going to transfer to mainly because I don't see a point in planning more than 2 years in advance if I don't even know what school I want to transfer to.

Is this a decent plan do you think?

POST: Hello Reddit,

I was given a Bobbafett (is that how you spell it?) helmet during Christmas. After derping around with my friends enough, I decided to make something cool with it: A Daft Punk style helmet, with LED lights and all that jazz.

I don't know if it's possible to do that using the Bobbafett helmet. And my friends didn't seem to be interested in the idea, thus I want to ask Reddit for inputs.

Do you guys know where I can start from? Oh, also - I have hardly any experiences with electronics as well as craftsmanship skills. Thanks, reddit.

That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

POST: Just like the title says. I read these posts daily because it was automatically added to my front page (on mobile). 

My(20M) gf (20) has never done anything in our relationship that has led me to believe she would do something that could hurt me but these posts have made me lose faith in people. I see posts daily of cheaters and how terrible some people can be about it; it makes me think any one of my friends is capable of anything.
      As I said before my gf has never given me any hint of infidelity but this subreddit makes me think anything is possible. She is avidly against cheaters so I always assumed that she would never do anything like that but I say a comment earlier today that said, ""people hate about others what they hate the most about themselves"". I think I need to stop looking at these posts.

TITLE: Me (29 F) with ex (29 M), wondering if I should try and start things again?
POST: My ex an I broke up in December for the following reasons:
-Possibly incompatible future plans
-Different personal habits (he's very meticulous, I'm pretty slap dash and we get annoyed at each other)
-He messages other women and numerous points in our relationship, even after we agreed to be monogamous (this is the big one, of course)
-He's from a different culture and making his family accept me would be difficult.
-Different communication styles (more open vs contained)
-When together, we both felt hesitation/had difficulty committing to a future together.

The following is why I want to get back together:
-I miss him
-He's said he could stop messaging others/commit if we get back together
-I don't know if I'll ever find anyone that I'm that connected to

POST: I (23/f) left my first love (same age) when I was 19. It was long distance, we were both co-dependent and not trusting of each other. I think in the end we were both smothering each other. But i broke it off two years in. First kiss, first sex first everything. I never gave him closure.

Fast forward and I have been in a wonderful relationship for almost two years. I couldn't be happier. The problem is, and I know this sounds strange, but I keep having dreams (that do not correspond to any feelings in my normal life) in which I meet and have conversations and make amends with my first love - maybe like 3 times a week for the past couple months.

Do I ignore these dreams? With knowing that a ""fuck off"" or no response might occur should I reach out to my ex On positive terms? Not for a fuck, or a mind fuck or anything similar. Just to make amends. Or am I crazy?

My partner claims this is all innocent and simply a means of escape, I however feel deeply hurt.

POST: Hey. 20F dating 22M for almost four months, and things just aren't really working out. I want to have feelings for him, but I don't.

Anyway, we're in a not-quite-long-distance relationship--he lives an hour away and drives to see me once a week. I know that generally when breaking up with someone you're supposed to do it face-to-face, but I feel like it would be unfair to make him drive all the way to see me only to be broken up with and have to drive back. Would a phone call be acceptable?

Also, if he asks why specifically I'm breaking up with him, how in depth should I go? I mean, there aren't any smoking guns or anything, I just... I don't miss him when he's not around, and I don't get excited to see him apart from the sex.

TITLE: What should I put in a care-package for my unemployed friend?
POST: A friend of mine just lost his job because the office of the ad agency he worked for shut down. He had about two weeks notice which was obviously not enough time to find a new job. He's free-lancing now, but the income is unstable and no where near what  he used to make. SO, my idea was to send him a care package of sorts with random things that he might like that he wouldn't buy for himself with his current budget constraints. For example, I'm going to buy him some film because he likes to take pictures with vintage 35mm cameras, but may not be able to splurge on the film now. What else can I put in? My budget is around $50.00.

TITLE: What to do while waiting for light at end of the tunnel?
POST: In the past three months I've reduced my total debt from about $20,000 to $9,200.  While it's possible I can do the same for the $9,200 with commissions I am not and have not budgeted for possibilities.

I've budgeted out the next year based on my minimum income with no commission.  This plan sees me debt free by August 2016.  All of my expenses are covered, and any commission I receive  moves my debt-free date forward.

The budget factors in savings, my HSA, and my simple IRA to get my employers max contribution.

My question is, now what?  All I do is eat, sleep, work, gym, and repeat.  I've deactivated Facebook, I don't party, I quit drinking, and I got rid of my car since I live in a metroplex and walk or uber pretty much everywhere I need to go.  This actually costs less than having a car in my situation.

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract).

TITLE: My girlfriend [23F] keeps telling me about her infatuation with celebrities and I [22M] am uncomfortable with it.
POST: My girlfriend of 2 years likes to go on and on about how much she likes certain k-pop stars. Usually, I'm okay with listening to it and I'll humor her, but it does get on my nerves at times. Sometimes, I feel like some of the things she says can be inconsiderate and hurtful, like I am lacking or not right for her (I would leave you for someone famous, I would sleep with him if he smiled at me like that, etc). 

So I tried to rationally tell her that I was uncomfortable, but her rationale is that its a celebrity and as we are non-famous folk, it would never actually happen, therefore I should not be so sensitive. And then she turns it around and says that I don't have self confidence and that I should work on getting more confidence. 

So, is it irrational of me to feel the way I'm feeling?

The whole situation is traumatizing for me. I'm 25 years old, male, and this is the first time my mother has done something like that. I have NOTHING against her screwing other dudes, however the guy is not only almost 20 years younger then her but she did it literally a few meters away from me.

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 10 months now. And we literally just broke up 30 minutes ago. What happened was that we both realized we were different. She thought we wanted different things. I thought that we loved a person differently(ie. I felt she didn't love me the same way I loved her). Now I feel incredibly ok. Not that im ecstatic but I feel a lot better(we had broken up twice before and got back together each time). I think it's because I finally realized that we're different and love each other differently. So reddit, have you had any similar experiences where you felt surprisingly fine after a break up? If so, did you know why?
P.S. we are still best friends and we are going to maintain a close relationship purely as friends.

Throughout the night we had this super nice waitress hooking us up with free food which was awesome. At last call, as we stumbled out of the bar, my brother said we had forgot to tip her so he gave me a 20 and I ran back inside, gave her the tip, and said ""You're super cute, have a great night!"" and ran back outside to get a cab. That's it. No flirting happened over the course of the night, no touching, no numbers were recieved but I still feel really guilty, I guess for saying that she was cute!

Apparently me asking this killed the mood for her. I don't feel I was wrong for asking because we were both still pretty buzzed and since I felt she was out if it, I had to ask. No intercourse happen that night but would you, as a female, feel rejected or have any other negative feelings based on my actions?

TITLE: Reddit, I'm in need of some advice. Can you help?
POST: Ok, here's a little bit of background information. I recently started talking to this girl, who happens to be my ex-girlfriend's good friend. I really like her... I've never met someone who I can talk to for five hours and still want to keep talking. Talking to her has been the most fun I've had in a really long time. Last night, we both admitted that we had feelings for each other. 

Unfortunately, my ex-girlfriend found out we had been talking. She immediately proceeded to tell her friend that she cannot talk to me anymore. 

This girl is now stuck in the awkward situation of having to decide to see me and let go of her friend, or listen to my ex and let go of me. I've been feeling too shitty about putting her in this situation to come up with a solution. So, Reddit, I turn to you. What should I/she do?

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

TITLE: Going from Masters Degree to Hitchhiking?
POST: So my brother is graduating with a bachelors degree soon and wants to stay another year and a half to get his masters degree. He's recently developed this great idea that after graduating, he wants to hitchhike across the country and perform circus type tricks to make ends meet (unicycle, hacky sack, juggling, etc). He doesn't want a 9-5 job where he's tied down and just wants to go live life freely. He cited The Spartan Student as a reference as to how he can make it work ([link] To make things worse, he doesn't have plans as to what he wants to do with his masters degree in computer science. He just wants to get it because it's only another year after his bachelors.

Does anyone have any sort of experience with this type of mentality? What are the dangers of living like that? Do others think this is as dumb as I think it is?

Yesterday my girlfriend went out and got blackout drunk the other night, kissed her gay male friend. One of her friends had a go at her for doing this as she didn't realise he was gay.

My girlfriend then calls me drunkenly afterwards. Crying, saying that she's sorry she kissed him.

The day after I've confronted her about it and she's obviously very very sorry. Has text her friends to find out if anything else happened and relayed that to me.

I feel like this shouldn't be a big deal but at the same time it is... she kissed someone other than me, whilst drunk.

The problem is that everything seems to remind me of her. Almost anything I do or see brings back some memory of her. I'll see some food and remember that was a food she liked, and just like that, she's back in my head. 

Sometimes it'll be some memory that comes up out of the blue. I'll be doing nothing and I'll remember the time we went out on a date somewhere or some other time we spent together.

Is there a way to stop this, or is it just something that will go away with time. I know that I can't just wipe her from my memory, she'll always be there, but is there a way to make it happen less, or hurt less? I know I could get over her much easier if I was able to get her out of my head.

POST: Things are getting shaky. We argue more and more every day. Weve lived together for about a year. Not looking to break up but I want to be prepared with regard to our lease.

We entered into lease for a place together. I'm the bread winner. I pay the lease every time. We have 9 months left. She gives me about 25% of the lease (what she can afford to help out with).

If we break up can I kick her out? Is she financially responsible for a portion of the lease?

Just looking for advice around that and also the best way to proceed.

I was at his place last night and I cant help but feel like hes not into me anymore. When I asked if he wanted to hang out he said ""if you want to"". And hes just barely texted me since I left. I'm not sure what happened because I thought things were going well.

TITLE: [CA] leasing or purchasing a car for lyft and or uber
POST: I[M, 21] am a full time college student. Currently only have a motorcycle. Was looking at uber lease program but researching there are many restrictions. 

I have not checked my credit in about give or take 6 months, last time it was in the 670 range. I have paid off a bank loan and maintained my credit. Is it realistic to lease a car for rainy days and pay off bills. 

Not paying rent, just various bills that don't pass 300 a month total. So I am thinking of leasing a car, probably not from uber or lyft, and drive enough to just pay my bills.

It is also my understanding to apply as a driver for uber and or lyft ahead of time so I don't get stuck with car payments and I don't pass background checks for whatever reason.

POST: I had old running shoes and was still running, so I went and got a good pair (had my foot measured and checked to make sure I got the right ones for me). Since then, I have ran two time, my knee pain went away, however I am still getting a pain in my shin. It is in the front of my shin, and only hurts for the first quarter mile then it is gone and I enjoy the run. Is this normal? Is it dangerous for me to keep running like this?? I hope not b/c I am so happy to be running again. I do not have any pain walking, before or after the run either.

POST: So I started talking to this girl after I met her online and this fall I will be about an hour away from here while I am away at college. She really wants to meet me and spend time with me (She implied doing other things but that is not super important to me). She is somewhat attractive to me and she is nice enough.

Here is the problem I am having. She said she is going to breakup with her boyfriend so we can date (I had never even implied I wanted to date her). She said she loved me and cried when I didn't say it back and she has multiple times gotten very upset when I did not respond to her text and she even went as far as adding me on Facebook.

Should I actually meet up with her? It could be a good time but there are a lot of things that concern me about her. If I should not, how should I separate myself from her?

However, the age difference is always in the back of my mind, making me wonder if I'm doing something wrong by dating him.  He's still in college and I've graduated a little while ago... And I know people say that dating younger mean's you're not mature enough to date someone your own age.

Does that apply to this 3-year age difference?  If so, how do I know if that's why I chose him?

I found out she was hooking up with some guy from work for a few months during the time of our breakup.

She recently reached out saying that she really misses me and wants to get back together. I'm not so sure though.

There are a bunch of annoying rules he's imposed post-me moving in, he's probably the stingiest person I've ever met, and he's decided that it's acceptable for the heat to be at 5ºC when no one's home, 10ºC when sleeping, and 15ºC when someone's home and awake (41, 50, and 59ºF, respectively) thus resulting in me being fucking freezing always. I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June.

POST: Hey, this is my first time posting to this sub.  I have recently (3-4) months started seeing a new girl, and everything is great.  We communicate well, have fun together and really get along, and have a very satisfying and healthy sex life.  I am very attracted to her physically and mentally, and feel she is too.

The only problem is, I have seen pictures of her exes, and they are VERY attractive.  It has made it hard for me to accept when she says I am cute/hot/sexy because I don't really compare in my mind...it has really hurt my self-confidence and I don't really know how to get past this.

I'm not saying this is a deal breaker or anything close, not even an issue besides that I kinda just don't feel attractive anymore.  Someone please give me any advice or reassurance.

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?

TITLE: [Sacramento, California] Renting a house. Water heater is old and insufficient, but not broken. Landlord's or tenant's responsibility to upgrade?
POST: Location: Sacramento, California, US

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

 So I get to move out, but she still wants to date me, too.  I want nothing more than her, I'd never been happier.

I know that's wrong.  Who has good tips on how to make the right decision and stick to it?  Also, anyone just feel like chatting?  The emptiness and lonlieness is deafening around here.

POST: We were really good friends before we went out, then we went out for about a year. She broke up with me 6 months ago, and I haven't seen her since, although we still chat from time to time on Facebook.

Anyway, she lives in a different city to me, which I'm going to next week, and I reckon I'm going to stop by and say hello to her and her family. She's definitely over me, so there's no danger on that front. It took me a month or two of no contact and spending time with other people, but now we have fun chatting like we used to, and I don't think of her that way anymore either.

Since I have less experience of breakups and relationships than some of the people on here, just wondered if this is a bad idea. I should add that she responded positively when I mentioned the idea to her.

When I was in college attending a hockey game, I walked by the 50/50 raffle booth. I had always thought of entering, but as a poor college student a dollar was worth more at McDonalds than the odds were of winning. 

However, this time as I walked by I thought, what the hell, and dropped in two dollars. This was around Christmas time, so I was pretty poor. 

During the hockey game they announced the winner, and I ended up being the lucky draw.

I won somewhere around 160$.

It was enough to buy a few Christmast presents that I wasn't able to afford prior to winning.

Seems like whenever she comes by or has something going on at her place we end up hanging out with her/doing what she wants to do. 

She's known my boyfriend and his roommate for a while. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because it seems like she has zero interest in getting to know me/talking to me. I also have a gut feeling that she might be interested in my boyfriend but I have nothing really to back it up. I just don't feel comfortable hanging out around her and it makes me look forward less to the weekends because now I can expect to see her.

I don't know how to bring this up without sounding weird and jealous.

POST: So I have a fear of commitment when I enter into relationships. This is the main reason none of them have worked out. Last night I was laying in bed thinking and I think I know where it stems from.

I feel that my fear of commitment is more deeply rooted by my fear of failure. I fear giving 100% of myself to something, only to have the possibility of failure (rejection). If I don't commit 100% to the relationship, it is much easier for me to move on if there is a break up (there always is). 

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

POST: So my old roommate tries to hangout with me and my new roommates every weekend. At first I tried to tell my roommates not to let him come but they thought I was being irrational. Now he feels like he is part of the group and we all want him out. He used to invite himself over all the time and we finally got him to stop doing that. But we don't want him to be around anymore. I told my roommates the only way to deal with it is to just straight up tell him that we don't want to hang out with him anymore, but we don't know how to go about it without saying it outright. What is the best way to handle this situation? 

BTW- he is an alcoholic so we want to let him down easy so he doesn't go crazy with alcohol.

TITLE: A relationship that ""is"" reverting back to one that  ""isn't"".
POST: So not long ago I (26M with 24F) [sought advice on a relationship changing from a good friendship to a relationship](

So when we got together after the Christmas break, things were sort of stilted and awkward. I figured something was up, so I didn't make any sort of advances and when she left after last weekend, things got even more distant. By weeks end, I asked her to talk about it and she admitted that she perhaps wasn't as ready for a relationship as she had professed.

That's fine, it is what it is... but now I'm having a bit of a rollercoaster trying to figure out how to rebottle the genie after having a conduit for the feelings I had for her. That said, she's one of the best friends I've had or could ever hope to have and to her, the friendship is ironclad... so if anyone has any thoughts on how I can quash the neuroses and get back into that stride, I'd appreciate it.

I noticed that during the week, when I'm watching TV or browsing reddit, I tend to get hungrier more often. I just want to eat when I know I shouldn't. But on the weekends I eat less than I usually do and don't seem to get hungry. I still browse the internet and watch TV probably a similar amount, but it's when I have free time and when I also do something else: play videogames.

Something about focusing or getting entirely absorbed in a good game somehow gets me through a whole day, almost forgetting to eat. I've experienced the same thing when reading or writing something, anything that gets me to focus all of my attention on it.

They finally produced it this week and my landlord said i can move in on the weekend. However, he says that as it has taken 4 weeks, he wants me to share the cost of the rent for the past 4 weeks before I move in. Is this okay to do? He had not passed over they keys or allowed me to move in until the bank had produced the reference, which was held up on no fault of my own. He is refusing to allow me to pay rent from just my moving in day. Can I get some advice on whether he is being fair or if there is something I can do?! Thanks! (I live in the UK if that is relevant at all)

POST: So my brother is graduating with a bachelors degree soon and wants to stay another year and a half to get his masters degree. He's recently developed this great idea that after graduating, he wants to hitchhike across the country and perform circus type tricks to make ends meet (unicycle, hacky sack, juggling, etc). He doesn't want a 9-5 job where he's tied down and just wants to go live life freely. He cited The Spartan Student as a reference as to how he can make it work ([link] To make things worse, he doesn't have plans as to what he wants to do with his masters degree in computer science. He just wants to get it because it's only another year after his bachelors.

I know a lot of companies hire college grads way in advance, but I don't know if companies will hire people this far in advance if they are already in the industry.

**Question:**

Do I apply for jobs now or wait (if so, how long)?  On one hand, I want to start applying now so I can have a job secured before I get out there.  On the other hand, I don't want to disqualify myself by applying to positions too soon.

I really need advice on this...

POST: I'm [M21], in college, and currently live at home until I graduate college because it's cheaper to live this way for now. Okay so I recently turned 21 a few months ago and legally bought a few bottles of alcohol, including vodka and whiskey and stored them in my desk. I looked for them earlier today and they are gone. Apparently, my parents raided my desk and took them away. I am confused why they did this, should I be upset, or should I let it go? It feels like my privacy has been invaded more than anything else.

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

When I asked her out I thought she was about 23 or 24 since she looks really young, however, I found out last night that she is in fact 31 years old. While 31 is not old in the slightest, she is a bit older than I am, and since I've never been in this situation before, I'm feeling a bit confused. She is in the same place in life as me and is at my maturity level,",I recently asked a beautiful woman out and was surprised to find out that she is 6 years older than me.

TITLE: I'm writing a letter to my girlfriend's father to win his acceptance. What can I say?
POST: I met the girl 3 years ago - her and I have been inseparable since. We are now both 20.

Like any relationship too good to be true though, there was one huge issue - disapproval from her parents. 

I am asian; they are italian and deeply catholic. That almost explains the whole story! She's not old enough to move out, and instead stays at home with parents that did not let her step outside the house through the whole summer. Recently, things worsened to the point where her parents called me, threatening to kick her out if I continued to see her.

Now, her and I are together in secret. I realize it can't be this way forever, so I figured writing a letter would be the best way to clear things up! Reddit, how do I go about this without infuriating them even more?

TITLE: M[19] just ended a long-distance relationship with F[17]. She wants to meet up as 'friends' next week.
POST: I broke up with my girlfriend after just over a year of seeing her last night. A couple of months ago I moved to uni over 2 and a half hours away and the long distance has effectively ruined our relationship. Neither of us were happy so I decided that it would be best to end it.

She is my first true love and we've experienced everything for the first time with each other, so letting go of that was very hard. She wants to see me as 'just friends' which would mean her coming up to stay with me for 2 days next week. I feel that this is either going to make this break up even harder, or that we will end up getting back together, only for us to have to go through this pain again at a later stage.
Is seeing each other a good idea, or should I tell her that I think it's best if we both had some space? Thank-you for any responses.

TITLE: Want to win a past flame back, does the ""epic declaration of love"" speech work in real life?
POST: Set up: I'm sick in love with a girl I dated a few years ago. We never really broke up, I graduated and moved, she began traveling for a few months. It just sort of stopped, with no hard feelings. Now we're in the same city, both unattached, and see each other often, in social settings.

The problem is, I can never seem to get her alone anymore, and don't really feel any interest from her at all. She's always been hard to read, and we never really spoke about how we ended, so my thought is I just need to lay my feelings bare in an ""epic declaration of love speech"" in one of the few times I can talk one-on-one. But, you know, fear of rejection, fear of ruining one of the few moments we have together, etc. Any stories of these working in real life?

apparently to other people it sounded like I was pissed and meant it because a lady in front of me immediately apologized profusely.

I felt really bad because she sounded genuinely concerned.

it was also embarrassing because it looked for a bit like a young white girl just growled at a nice african american mother.

We've been together for three years I didn't expect this to bother me. Something about saving these pictures and posting them on reddit crosses a line though.

1. The jealousy. I'm a little jealous that he thinks about this chick enough to post her photos on another website for people to jerk of too. He already fb creeps on her all the time...this too?

2. The lack of respect he is showing for this girl. It's not like she's some random hot girl he found a picture of, this is someone he's known for a few years, maybe they even hooked up. It seems like some immature desperate reaching for some power over her.

TITLE: Exercise bike calorie counter.
POST: I recently decided to be more thorough about losing weight. I was losing weight at a nice speed about a year ago, roughly 1lb a week. Then we had a baby and got all the weight back. The exercise I was mostly doing was on an exercise bike in front of my pc. I set up a playstation controller so I could cycle and play games and watch youtube videos and netflix. It works quite well and I usually spend 1- 1 1/2 hours on the bike.

And now on to the question. My bike says in my last cycle I burned 350 calories in 90 mins ( I know I cycle slowly. It's kinda in the background as I play or watch videos. It's usually about 10 - 13 mph). I just started on a website called sparkpeople and they list exercises and when I added the exercise as 90 minutes it said it should be 900 calories for exercise bike <12mph.
