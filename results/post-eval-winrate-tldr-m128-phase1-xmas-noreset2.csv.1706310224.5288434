TITLE: I [21M] have a huge crush on my co-worker [22F]. Was I just friend-zoned?
POST: I get along extremely well with this girl. We have the exact same sense of humour and never run out of things to talk about. 

I'm always really shy around girls, and was too scared to straight up ask her out. Basically there was an event in the city that we both really wanted to go to, so I casually asked if she would want to go, and she agreed. But when it came to the day, a couple of her friends showed up too. I really wanted it to just be the two of us.

I still have a crush on her, but I don't want things to be weird between us at work. I'm a relationship noob and this was the first girl I ever really liked.

Was I definitely friend-zoned?

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

I'm currently in a dead-end job, and the company I've applied for can really be a game changer for me in terms of career direction and progression so I'm really looking to make the best impression I can.

TITLE: Have any of you (or your kids) managed to pull a dresser (or other piece of furniture) down on top of yourself?
POST: I was about 4.  We had a HUGE white dresser (probably just a normal one, but in my memory it was HUGE).  And I put all my clothes in the top 2 drawers.  That way, I had empty space at my level in which I could play games, or hide things, or whatever.  Also, I used to climb on top of the dresser a lot and heavy drawers were hard to pull out to make steps to get on top of the dresser.  This created an unstable equilibrium which I was not aware of at that time.  Well, I was playing near my dresser one day, and bumped into it and it came toppling over on top of me.  It ended up falling half onto the bed, so it didnt squish me.  But I was terrified.  And that was my first lesson on ""center of gravity.""

POST: Me and my gf have been together for over 6 years, within the last 2 years our sex lives has plummeted. During that time we have both gained weight (I don't think we find each other attractive at the minute) and have been working opposing shifts for that time. She is always exhausted when coming back from work, I have always been the one to initiate sex, however I feel guilty if she is always tired. 

To compensate I've just been fapping 2-3 times a day to internet porn. Which I have begun to realise is a quick solution to a long term problem. The annoying thing is we really connect and still enjoy kissing, hugging and spooning but the passion has faded. 

Really I'm looking for any advice from anyone who has been through something similar and how to pull through it.

So I've been going to school with this girl for the past two years now and we're graduating from college on Thursday. She broke up with her boyfriend back in December and ever since then we've been really close.

We'd cuddle in her room and stuff, but we got into a big argument about a month ago and we've slowly been building our relationship back up.

TITLE: Is it going to get better?
POST: I've been pretty slack in terms of reading novels for say the past 10 years (except for Harry Potter), but decided over the last few months to get over myself and get back into reading.

I've got a list of good books to read (no idea where from) and decided to just buy book titles based on the title alone.

I read 1984 (pretty awesome) and then read The Wind Up Bird Chronicle (I finished both of them!).

I enjoyed both of them, my only problem being that I am struggling to read them and maintain interest for prolong periods of time. I will read 2 pages and get exhausted. Or read 3-4 pages and realise I haven't taken anything in.

Is this something that is going to improve? At the moment it feels like reading is a chore as opposed to a leisure activity.

The next book on my list is Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep.

Anyway, we're in a not-quite-long-distance relationship--he lives an hour away and drives to see me once a week. I know that generally when breaking up with someone you're supposed to do it face-to-face, but I feel like it would be unfair to make him drive all the way to see me only to be broken up with and have to drive back. Would a phone call be acceptable?

Also, if he asks why specifically I'm breaking up with him, how in depth should I go? I mean, there aren't any smoking guns or anything, I just... I don't miss him when he's not around, and I don't get excited to see him apart from the sex.

TITLE: The relationship between me [22M] and my GF [21] is becoming boring/stale. What to do?
POST: After reading some other threads on this subreddit I feel like our problem isn't so serious, but I would love some tips/advice nevertheless.

I've known this girl for over 6 years and has been one of my two best friends since 4 years or so. Since two months we're in a relationship. We know eachothers ins and outs, know everthing we did/do, spoken of everthing happened in our lives etc etc. The problem is, we don't have much to say to eachother anymore and running a bit out of things to do together.

Recently we've watched all 4 seasons of Game of Thrones and now we're kinda figuring out what to do when we are together. A couple of days ago we agreed to go for a walk every evening. Something we both enjoy. But it doesn't fill a whole evening, let alone a whole day. Does /r/relationships have any tips/advice on how to give some new life to our relation?

TITLE: Finding Cosigners Outside of Family
POST: I'm not asking anyone here to cosign, I know that's against the rules, and it's not really what I'm gunning for. Here's my story:

I have not yet graduated from my school, but I haven't been enrolled for ~15 months. I will remain a student until I independently finish this one last requirement and get cleared for graduation.

My mom may need to move soon, and she'll need to get a mortgage on a new house. She's also the cosigner on my (private) student loans, totaling ~$123k. With that debt hanging over her, she and her wife can't get a mortgage.

Consolidating my loans is something I've been intending to do regardless. I want to do it to get the loans out of her name, but despite a decent salary ($60k), my debt-to-income ratio and credit score are too high to qualify independently for just about any options. What I really need is someone who can cosign a consolidation.

TITLE: Guy to girl ratio on reddit?
POST: I haven't been a Redditor for as long as most people on here but I am no virgin to the social aspect of technology. However in my long endeavors as social media fanatic as well as a long term online gamer most of my interactions have been with other males as far as members of xbox live and other social media outputs. Lately I have realized that when I read a post on Reddit I automatically assume that the OP is male. I guess I'm just curious as to what the ration for guys to girls is on reddit itself. The easiest way I can see to go about doing this is to post a comment that states what gender you are or whatever else input you have on the subject.

I'm a 21 year old female and I look like I'm 16/17. I can't stand it! I still get carded for R rated movies. And while I know that looking young will benefit me when I'm older, I want to look my own age.

POST: So my girlfriend is 17 and the other day she was rolling up to a traffic light when it turned yellow and the person in front of her slammed on the brakes. She slammed on them too and her car skidded. Luckily shes okay. But now when she has to speed through a yellow light to make it she gets scared. Also shes scared when people get ready to make turns even though she has the right of way. I asked her and she said that shes scared that if something happens her car wont be able to stop in time. 

Shes coming over thursday and i offered to take her to a parking lot to drive her car and stop short and stuff to show her that her car is okay and will stop shortly if she needs to. Does anyone have any ideas about what tests to do to show her its safe? Thanks guys.

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone. When I first got him, about a week ago, I was taking him out every 2-3 hours but could rarely get him to goto the bathroom. Instead, he just comes inside walks around my apartment for 10 minutes and then goes. I've tried every hour on the hour as well. It's been a week now and he's consistently doing this no matter how long we take him out for. We went on a nice long walk yesterday (thanks to warm weather) and he barely sniffed the ground. But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times. What am I doing wrong? Any tips are appreciated!

TITLE: Help! Sibling Rivalry: five years apart and cannot get along.
POST: I am a male 22 and my brother is 17. I came out to California to visit my parents and younger brother for 12 days and after day three I'm already getting on the plane and flying back home. The problem is that I cannot get along with my younger brother and it drives my parents to the point where they cannot stand me being there any longer. I call my brother fat and tease him about being lazy which makes my parents fire back at me and tell me to stop. I try to do my best to avoid this topic but for some reason feel compelled to verbally attack him. Can anyone who may have been or is in a similar situation give me some advice on how to improve my relationship with my younger brother. I see him rarely now and just need to stop this all together.

We've known each other for about four to five months, and have been close for about three of those. We've decided to start dating after the finals (we're both college students). Feel free to ask for more information if you feel like there's something I should've mentioned!

TITLE: Reddit, how would you costume a 19th century Fisherman, à la Captain Nemo?
POST: I'm putting together a pretty good costume idea for Halloween this year that involves a not-so-period-perfect 1850's fisherman.  I've done some research and I've decided to stray away from the actual period clothing.  Its difficult to find leather shoes and britches- petticoat or otherwise.  

Here's what I'm planning on:

- Wool coat, preferably a pea coat
- Thigh waders
- Turtleneck
- Stocking cap
- slacks, thick cotton
- worn wooden tobacco pipe

Take in to account I don't have any of these items on hand and I'm working with a reasonable budget.  From that list, do you think its possible to convey a ""swarthy fisherman persona""?  Is there something you would do differently?

Its rare that I would put this much advanced planning in to costume but I've had the idea all year.

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

What should I do now?

2. The lack of respect he is showing for this girl. It's not like she's some random hot girl he found a picture of, this is someone he's known for a few years, maybe they even hooked up. It seems like some immature desperate reaching for some power over her.

My girlfriend of three years told me that she doesn't associate with either gender and wants me to stop addressing her as anything female related.

We keep a long distance relationship so I can't go to her and comfort her in person, only via MSN for now.

POST: Hey Reddit, first post. Hope you guys can help.

I've been talking to this girl for roughly two weeks now and we've gone on a handful of dates. If I had to describe the feeling, I'd say it's overwhelming. Overwhelming because I've never clicked/felt this strongly about anyone before and it's scary in a way.

If we're being honest, I feel like she is the one. But that's a conversation for another day.

Anyways, it's obvious we are both very into each other. She has sent me sweet texts saying how much she can't wait to see me again in between dates and we are both very comfortable with each other.

Now, since I like her so much and everything is going so well right now, my biggest fear is messing things up. Obviously I want to be official and have a real relationship with her, but I don't want to ""move too fast"" or rush things if that makes sense.

POST: I'm a male in my third year of college. Because of personal issues, I haven't really had a chance to make any friends. I want to start talking to more people to get social skills.

I thought a good idea would be to talk to girls in my class. I'm not really in a position to date anyone right now, so I just want to be friends.

My classes are usually pretty big with a lot of empty seats, so I'm afraid that if I just go sit beside a girl and try talking to her, even though their are a ton of other empty seats, she'll think I'm hitting on her and I'll scare her off.

So my question is, how do I talk to girls in class without them thinking I'm hitting on them and getting scared off? Also, because of being a loner my entire life, I'm extremely awkward and have no social skills whatsoever, so the conversations are going to be very awkward for both of us at first.

TITLE: What would you do Reddit?
POST: So this is quite possibly the most convoluted situation I have ever found myself in. I recently discovered that my partner has a secret online persona which they use to engage in online relationships. These range from innocuous to cybersexual/planning to meet. My partner claims this is all innocent and simply a means of escape, I however feel deeply hurt.  My partner feels betrayed as well because a mutual friend sent me the screen shots of the aforementioned evidence. This I agree was a violation on their part of his trust. However I feel like there was a much deeper violation of my trust when for the entirety of our relationship this has been occurring. I don't want to lose my best friend if this is something I should view as innocent but I also don't want to play the victim again.

TITLE: I [19 M], will be stuck on a farm with my [20 F] girlfriend's ex-girlfriend [19(?) F] all summer.
POST: I'm a college student, and about a month ago I entered into a long-distance relationship (and my first relationship in general) with a girl I met on Facebook a year ago. (I realize that that in itself is strange, but things are going quite well so far, so I'm not worried about it). 

I wound up applying to intern on a sustainable farm this summer, and got accepted. When I got the acceptance email, however, I discovered that my girlfriend's ex (who goes to the same school as I do) will also be interning there.

So basically, I'm going to be stuck all summer at a tiny farm with my girlfriend's ex. There are a total of four interns there, so I can't really avoid her. The thing is, she doesn't know that my gf and I are together. Should I tell her beforehand, and if so, how? Or am I better off just keeping things a secret?

We've had a crush on each other since october, but started really acting on things ~2 months ago.

I wouldn't want to seem like I'm trying too hard or am too invasive too, which makes me unsure how to act.

POST: My boyfriend and I just celebrated our anniversary and we're ridiculously happy. I looked back through our pictures and noticed how much weight he's gained.
  
I'm a person who cares about my health and I know that he doesn't care as much, that's fine, to each their own. But, when he was getting dressed I noticed he's put on a lot of weight on his stomach, which isn't healthy and is very hard to get rid of.
  
I'm not concerned about his looks, I'll love him no matter what he looks like. I'm concerned about his health because diabetes runs on both sides of his family. He doesn't drink a lot, so it's not beer weight it's just weight gain.

I am a student on an F-1 Visa in the US. I wanted to buy short term bonds online from solarcity instead of keeping my all my savings in the bank. I did so, however at the checkout page it asked me to confirm that I am a resident alien.

I wrongly thought that I am a resident alien because I fulfill the ""substantial presence test"". What I did not know is that F-1 Visa holders are exempt from that test. I learned this only after buying the bonds. What should I do now?

It started off simple with things like turning everything in the cubicles backwards, tilting computer screens, etc, until last week when my group (the girls) completely wrapped everything in the boy's cubicles in tinfoil and saran wrap (computer moniters, chairs, speakers, printers, pens, staplers, cups, literally everything) while they were all out of the office, so they were unable to get into their cubes the next day. They are now planning something big to get us all back (probably on Friday since all of the girls will be gone), so we need to start planning ways to retaliate. Please help us Reddit!

She was meaning something else with getting at her friend and then told her that I was into her by accident since I believed the conversation was heading in a different direction, and she hasn't responded to me in the last 8 hours.

In less than a month, I'm turning eighteen.

I've always been that person that never celebrated his own birthday. This is because I didn't really have any friends until I got out of middle school and because I always thought my parents were embarassing.

I do have some friends now, and I've been invited to several 18th birthday parties myself. However, I still do not  really want to celebrate my birthday. The house I'm living in is a mess and I wouldn't even know what to do or prepare for such a party. 

The real problem is that people ask me what I'm gonna do for my birthday etc. Whenever I tell someone that I haven't planned anything, they look overly surprised and I don't know what else to say. What am I supposed to do? Is the 18th birthday really a ""must-celebrate"" and will people be mad at me if I won't do it?

TITLE: Ex (21F) doesn't respond (23M)
POST: We had something of a mutual breakup - the relationship was stressing us both out. At her behest, we didn't communicate for the better part of 3 months. I then sent her a card for her birthday, one which she then called me to thank me for. 

When she called, she said she'd like to grab dinner sometime - we made plans. She called off the plans bc something came up and she couldn't make it. We rescheduled for Monday and, come Monday, she didn't respond. And she hasn't responded. And now I'm thinking she just doesn't want anything to do with me. 

I was ready to move on and be friends. My guess is she isn't? She wanted to hang out, called it off, and now isn't responding. It's been 4 days and I think that I'll text her once more this weekend and then not contact her at all. Thoughts?
TL;DR:","
