TITLE: My (16F) Mom (42F) blamed me for her failed marriage. Now she's trying to talk to me again.
POST: Background info: My parents (42F and 50M) are divorced. I live with my dad full time. 

Mom and I got into a heated argument about college. She claimed she didn't have the money to have me and my 3 sisters in college at the same time. My mom makes good money, she's a surgeon and my dad's a well respected and busy lawyer. I got really heated & careless and said that I didn't ask to be born and maybe she should've been more responsible with birth control. She then said that she and my dad only got married because of me and I'm the reason for her failed marriage. 

I believe her because it makes sense. My older sister (19) has a different dad than me. I was at my parents wedding when I was 6 months old. 

I haven't spoken to my mom since but I heard from my dad she wants to talk to me. What do I do? I'm incredibly angry and hurt.

POST: Hello Reddit!
Last october I told this girl my feelings towards her, but her response was what I've known but I had a lot to go through so I went along. Yes, it was a No. We were really close best friends, but for the past 2 years I felt a lot more( this as background). We've known each other for 9 years now, we were dating at the very beginning. I told her that I can't see her in order to help myself forget and move on, so I asked her not to write me or call me. Today is/was my birthday, and she wrote me, and told me the she's sorry to break my wish, but it's my birthday so she had to write. It pains me, I have to admit that she wrote me, I feel very down once again. The question I want to ask is, whether I should her write back anything at all or no? We are mature and quite different from our generation.
Thanks in advance!

TITLE: What are the pros/cons/potential pitfalls of adopting a data-only VoIP smartphone plan?
POST: The long story short is that I want to upgrade my phone but in the long run it will cost me hundreds (perhaps thousands) of dollars to do so because I would have to give up the unlimited data plan I have right now. The desire to save money has fueled my research to find a different solution, and recently I stumbled on this article: 

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

TITLE: How necessary is a bachelor's degree?
POST: I'm a 18yo girl with good grades. (4.3 GAP on a 4.0 scale, 30 on my ACT) I love Spanish and all my language/ grammar classes, but I'm not interested in teaching. I hate seeing so many people get degrees in something they never use. I'm considering moving out and going to a community college for free, saving what money I can and trying to find a practical job with an associate's degree instead of continuing on to a 4yr university.

Is this a good game-plan? Traveling and being bilingual are my two biggest interests, but I think that a job such as a physical therapists assistant would be a good option simply because the job market is high and it requires little college.

I should mention that I have a job and am willing to continue working a lot, however my family has very little money, and I don't want debt from student loans. Any advice or comments would be appreciated!

TITLE: What if Justin Beiber is the next Michael Jackson?
POST: I know a lot of folks hate the little guy, but the other day I was listening to a song he did with Kany West, a remix to Runaway Love. It was pretty interesting, and it got me thinking, what if this kids the next MJ? 

In all do honesty, his current music isn't what we're all fans of, but keep in mind, he's young. He can't sing about dramatic life experiences, breakups, or heart ache, because he hasn't experienced that yet. As he matures, so will his music, and once that's combined with his talents he has the potential to be outstanding. 

So what does Reddit think, could Justin Beiber, potentially be the next Michael Jackson?

Why?  It isn't because i'm anti-social or anything like that.  It is because, in general, all the people i meet are of a much lower intelligence.  I either alienate them with my thought process or, more often, I can stand to have a conversation with them.

Is there some hobby i can pick up or some place i can go to interact with people more my speed?  Reddit, in general, has been a nice distraction within a community of (sometimes) like minded people.

POST: Apologies beforehand if this is an immature question.

So my gf [19] (been together for almost 3 years), her sister [18], a friend [F/20] and me [20] are going to a music festival. I have this problem that whenever we go to places, I'm always on top of her, as in almost glued to her. She asked me if I can giver her space tomorrow so she can hang out with her sister and her friend and I said of course, because that's what a good bf does right? 

Anyways, I do plan on giving her space but I want to know if there is a way to make her regret saying that so she can be stuck on me. It is a little hard to put into words but I just want her to no give me space, basically. Does the ""avoid her"" trick work in this situation? I just want her to be annoying and glued to me. Apologies beforehand if this is an immature question.

In reality she had been dating one of my friends for a year and I liked her since then (Friendzoned obviously) but he didn't treat her right and was really hurt by it. Her parents are also divorced and been through many dads, has been bullied a bit and abused. Perhaps it's easy for me because she's the first girl I've ever loved. But she feels bad for not explaining it to me (I told her to not worry about it, she doesn't have to explain anything, i can't force her feelings).

I use AT&T and will not be switching providers, so please use this information in your advice.  Price is of no concern, so use your imagination.  Not your literal imagination, though, because it is very hard for AT&T to bill me on that.

He started to walk around a bit earlier but has just been sleeping since, and wont let the other cats play with him. I can't really tell if his leg is swollen or not but he definitely seems to be in pain.

POST: My boyfriend of 7 months recently told me while he was drunk one evening that he's worried about a text message that I sent him a couple days before saying that I love him and that I'm serious about him and I'm the type of person who can't help but settle down. I'm like a penguin. He followed his concerns with a comment saying he is still in love with is ex-girlfriend. Of course this made me have concerns of my own feeling like I'm a rebound or his second place prize and what if she decides to come back in his life how do I know he won't leave me for her. I expressed these concerns and he tries to soothe me with saying that he only wants to be with me.

Now, the problem is that I lost a soul mate. She is the first to understand my problems, first that I opened up to, not just as a girlfriend, but as a person. She knows more about me than my parents. All that I had planned is now lost, I am lost, I don't know what to do and how to deal with this.

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company.

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends.

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

And there's a parade coming up this weekend, so I was thinking I'd ask her to that, and she if she wanted to get coffee before hand at a new cafe that she told me she'd like to try.

POST: Hi reddit, I have a 14 year old Wheaten Terrier. He is mostly deaf and has arthritis in his hips. Going upstairs is usually a trouble for him, but yesterday and today after his walk he shot right up the stairs, while usually I have to coax him all the way. I believe this is a confidence issue for him because whenever he slips a little, which happens a lot, he whimpers than comes back down. He usually eats in the basement and sleeps there (dont worry its a nice basement) but we keep the door open so he can come up. Recently we moved his food and bed upstairs to the main level so he doesn't have as much stress on his hips going up and down, but when we walk him or take him to the bathroom we go through the basement. We tried putting food at the top of the stairs and that has helped, do you think this is a confidence issue, or something to do with arthritis.

Okay, so I was in a relationship for 7 years (15-22) with someone. While we dated I put in all the effort, arranged fun dates and tried really hard to be the best gf I could be. He put in no effort and arranged no fun dates. I dated around with a few guys between 22-24, nothing longer than a few dates each. Now I'm with someone who I'm pretty serious about, dating 8 months now.

 In my first relationship I made it a pretty annual thing that we would go on an adventure tour. The only years we skipped were years I asked him to book the tour and he forgot until it was too late and they were sold out for the year. (it only runs June-August). This was something I wanted to do since I was 13 but wasn't old enough until 16.

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

TITLE: Question about knee pain at beginning of run
POST: I've been runnning for about 6 months now, have done a few 5ks and two 10ks (30min 5s, and about 1hr 10a). I've never had much access to professionals or other knowledgeable runners so I've come to my fellow runners for assistance. My knees (more specifically left more so that right) hurts for about the first minuet or two of a run, as in when I am warming up. After a very short while it does go away (usually about a city block or two). It feel like mainly the tendon that sits on the kneecap in the front and runs to shin (Patellar Tendon), feels like its tight.

My question is, is this ok or normal? I don't feel overly concerned but then again I've never received proper or professional training tips so for all i know its a big issue. Any advice if its abnormal or dangerous?

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?  The car i just leased is a 4 cyl engine...Now, after having driven it around town, i really wish i had gone for the V6, as everyone says the gas mileage really isn't that much different, and the power IS.  Also, the sound system is crap, and i would prefer the upgraded model with the better system.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

* My wedding is March in Key West (yay!). The weather should be mild (70s-80s). Weather permitting, the event will take place outside in the gardens of a historic home. I'm want the affair to feel like Kate Spade Garden Dinner Party - classic, but fun. Main color is navy with accents of green, pink, and metallics. 

* My first instinct was to put the girls in long dresses but the choices are less fun. Since this is a garden wedding in a tropical place, I don't want them to look overdone (or want the girls to be uncomfortable!). I found some shorter dresses that I LOVE but I'm unsure if my mixing and matching works or not.

POST: In the past three months I've reduced my total debt from about $20,000 to $9,200.  While it's possible I can do the same for the $9,200 with commissions I am not and have not budgeted for possibilities.

I've budgeted out the next year based on my minimum income with no commission.  This plan sees me debt free by August 2016.  All of my expenses are covered, and any commission I receive  moves my debt-free date forward.

The budget factors in savings, my HSA, and my simple IRA to get my employers max contribution.

My question is, now what?  All I do is eat, sleep, work, gym, and repeat.  I've deactivated Facebook, I don't party, I quit drinking, and I got rid of my car since I live in a metroplex and walk or uber pretty much everywhere I need to go.

POST: Me (18) and my Gf (18) have been going out for almost four years- since year 10. We are going to different schools at opposite ends of the country, and are both pretty neurotic/the jealous type so we have (wisely imo) decided to end it.

I've seen other serious relationships go totally down the toilet because of long distance issues, and people who used to be best friends end up not able to exist in the same room together.

I really love her, and all I want is to still maintain a functioning friendship with her, and perhaps when we finish our courses if the timing's right, we could get back together... Essentially what i'd like to know is is it possible to maintain a functioning friendship after so long together?

In France, we have about 20% charges on the ""brut"" salary, which then gives us the real remuneration. For example, if your remuneration is **30k€/year**, that will make you **24k€/year real remuneration** (or 2k/month).

I've been talking to this girl for roughly two weeks now and we've gone on a handful of dates. If I had to describe the feeling, I'd say it's overwhelming. Overwhelming because I've never clicked/felt this strongly about anyone before and it's scary in a way.

If we're being honest, I feel like she is the one. But that's a conversation for another day.

Anyways, it's obvious we are both very into each other. She has sent me sweet texts saying how much she can't wait to see me again in between dates and we are both very comfortable with each other.

Now, since I like her so much and everything is going so well right now, my biggest fear is messing things up. Obviously I want to be official and have a real relationship with her, but I don't want to ""move too fast"" or rush things if that makes sense.

POST: Okay so my girlfriend said she had stopped smoking weed. She gets tested, and I basically was trying to guide her to make the right decision. I caught her once before, and she told me she would never do it again. A couple nights ago she went to her friends house with her friends (all if whom smoke weed), and told me she wasn't going to. 

I'm not really proud of it, but she was asleep and I looked through her phone and low and behold, she was talking about getting stoned. How do I confront her about this without hinting towards me doing what I did to find out?

POST: I fell in love with the series a few years ago, and was keen to read all of the books before the next and final game came out next month, but tragically found out that not all of the books have been translated yet. I found one or two fan translations that were just way too poorly written for me to enjoy, with incorrect grammar, and spelling, so just gave up and went on to read other books while i waited for the official translations. I loved the books not only because of the story and amazing universe, but because the (english versions) were so amazingly well written, and fantastic reading experiences.

TITLE: Help get my friend's family out of harms way in Central America - Advice on immigration needed!
POST: Hi Reddit,

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

I told her on Monday that we needed to break up. She was surprised at first and understandably upset. I told her that we were just becoming two different people and that it would be better to end the relationship on a high note before we start to resent each other. 

She still wants to be friends, which I understand. I don't know if it will work out, but I told her that after a while of no contact we can reach out and see if we're ready to establish some kind of platonic relationship.

POST: (24) My best friend (Phil) of 12 years and I know this gorgeous girl (Bailey) who we have both been interested in for the past couple of years on and off. Recently it just so happened that we both are interested at the same time. He is the kind of person that will push you out of the way just so that he can stand/sit next to her. She has been throwing me signals and stuff but she also seems to do it to him also. He has always had girls chasing after him and I don't really get girls lusting towards me all the time like he does. So I am tempted to pursue a committed relationship with Bailey but I am afraid that Phil would be irrational and just stop the friendship right then and there. So reddit what do you recommend I should do?

Then a man walked up and gave 2 $20s to them and walked away. That still wouldn't complete the cost.

We are going to go through marriage counseling weekly at least.  During that period, we are entertaining her moving out to a nearby apartment while I stay in the home.

He has bad teeth, is overweight and has some other physical issues (acne etc.). He is however a wonderful, sweet person with a very giving personality. He is gay, which means he is having to navigate dating in the very shallow world of Grindr male hookups and so forth. He barely ever gets any attention.

POST: Back story:

So I've been going to school with this girl for the past two years now and we're graduating from college on Thursday. She broke up with her boyfriend back in December and ever since then we've been really close. We would hang out a lot and I even tried using some tricks to see if she's into me, like picking lint off of her shirt and she would do the same for me sometimes. Those kinds of things. We'd cuddle in her room and stuff, but we got into a big argument about a month ago and we've slowly been building our relationship back up. And even when I fuck up with her, she still lets me back in her life (I haven't fucked up since then.) I'm pretty sure she knows I like her, but should I just tell her in person that I do? Or is it too late? Just to get it off my chest. If she doesn't feel the same way, I still want to preserve our friendship. Anyway, should I?

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone. When I first got him, about a week ago, I was taking him out every 2-3 hours but could rarely get him to goto the bathroom. Instead, he just comes inside walks around my apartment for 10 minutes and then goes. I've tried every hour on the hour as well. It's been a week now and he's consistently doing this no matter how long we take him out for. We went on a nice long walk yesterday (thanks to warm weather) and he barely sniffed the ground. But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times. What am I doing wrong? Any tips are appreciated!

TITLE: Me [24f] still heart broken over butthead ex-boyfriend [29m]
POST: I realize that this is a question that is probably asked a million times, but it's something I'm struggling with - 

For a couple years, I've been in an on and off relationship with a guy who hasn't met my needs, hasn't made me happy and spends most of his free nights getting drunk, alone. There is no rational reason that I should still be pining after him -- but here I am. He's manipulating, awkward, mean... I honestly can't think of very many reasons to be heart broken, but I am. I'm not in love with him and I don't want to be with him, but I do miss him and it hurts that he's dating other people.

I just don't have the drive to have sex. I've tried to spice things up with toys and games, and they work sometimes but I just seem to have lost all drive. I still find him attractive, but I'm always tired and never in the mood (I'd rather watch TV or sleep, etc.). Anyone who has been in a long relationship before, did you experience this? Did it pass? Is it something that I am going to have to work at all the time? 

My theories as to why are either:
- It's typical with relationships this long, and it will pass.
- It's my birth control, and it's ruining my sex drive.

TITLE: Have any of you (or your kids) managed to pull a dresser (or other piece of furniture) down on top of yourself?
POST: I was about 4.  We had a HUGE white dresser (probably just a normal one, but in my memory it was HUGE).  And I put all my clothes in the top 2 drawers.  That way, I had empty space at my level in which I could play games, or hide things, or whatever.  Also, I used to climb on top of the dresser a lot and heavy drawers were hard to pull out to make steps to get on top of the dresser.  This created an unstable equilibrium which I was not aware of at that time.  Well, I was playing near my dresser one day, and bumped into it and it came toppling over on top of me.  It ended up falling half onto the bed, so it didnt squish me.  But I was terrified.  And that was my first lesson on ""center of gravity.""

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?
