POST: Hey, guys.  I've had my phone now for over five years and while it has more than stood the test of time, I think it's time to move on.  I'm looking for a phone that is 3G, or whatever G is the most current nowadays and probably a touch-screen of some sort.

I'd like to stay away from buying an iPhone as I feel the second I get one, it will quickly be replaced by the newest version that comes with a slightly larger headphone jack or some bullshit, rendering mine useless.

I use AT&T and will not be switching providers, so please use this information in your advice.  Price is of no concern, so use your imagination.  Not your literal imagination, though, because it is very hard for AT&T to bill me on that.

Then one day about 2 months after we met, he called me and said he didn't want a relationship while in college and that we should stop all communication between each other.

TITLE: How do you track shoe prices to get better deals?
POST: I started ""seriously"" running a few years ago (I'm a slow runner, but by ""serious,"" I mean doing it frequently and entering races). I went to Road Runner and found that the Mizuno Wave Creations were good for my feet. I used to get weird pains before, from an old injury, but they helped me feel much better after a run.

Anyway, I buy a new pair each year, since I put about 300-400 miles on them in 12 months anyway, but each year I was spending like $140 because the new versions had just come out.

Yesterday I hit Road Runner's sale and instead of shelling out $140-160 for the newest model, I just bought a way marked down (and UGLY!) version of last year's for $60 bucks. I'm happy about this, but I was wondering if there was a happy middle, where I can spend maybe $90-100 once a current year's model is a little old but not a whole year old.

TITLE: Is It Bullshit?: Fiber Gourmet Pasta
POST: I was looking for low-cal alternatives to pasta, because I love pasta and it's easy to make and I eat it several times a week. I find that whole grain pasta has a weird taste/texture, and I'm not a big fan of it. 

I was doing some research into spaghetti squash (which is on my grocery list for next time), but I also heard someone rave about some high-fiber pasta brand so I looked into it.

What sorcery is this? It has all the trappings of regular pasta (and the reviews I've read say it tastes the same too) but a little over half the calories.

TITLE: Moving to LA from DC in August/September. When should I start applying for jobs?
POST: **Background:**

I am a programmer from the DC area.  My wife is going to start grad school next Fall, so we will be packing up and moving to LA at the end of this summer (August/September... about 6 months from now).

**Problem:**

I'm afraid that my inability to start the job until the end of this coming Summer will disqualify me from most jobs currently available.  I know a lot of companies hire college grads way in advance, but I don't know if companies will hire people this far in advance if they are already in the industry.

**Question:**

Do I apply for jobs now or wait (if so, how long)?  On one hand, I want to start applying now so I can have a job secured before I get out there.  On the other hand, I don't want to disqualify myself by applying to positions too soon.

I really need advice on this...

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

During this time I had opened up about my depression(I had burns on my arms) which stemmed largely in part about me being confused about my sexuality.

The desire to save money has fueled my research to find a different solution, and recently I stumbled on this article: 

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

TITLE: I [19M] want my ex-girlfriend [18F] back, but I'm not sure how to do it.
POST: I broke up with my girlfriend in July because I was going to university and I would be moving out of the city and it would be difficult to be with each other. She had wanted to move in with me, but I had refused.

I thought I would get over her, but that has been unsuccessful. Before I actually moved out, I called her. She had another boyfriend already. I was crushed.

Fast forward three weeks, we are talking now, texting every day and Skyping rather frequently. She says she wants to break up with her boyfriend, and that she misses me. However, she still does not seem interested in getting back together.

Is there any hope for me? We are talking a lot now, and I really do love her, and it's killing me that she is hesitant to be with me again, despite how she always says how happy she was with me.

What do I do? Just play the waiting game?

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

So I was wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, being mean sure doesn't sound like a good way of changing this.

POST: Often, while my SO and I are watching a TV series together (entire thing start to finish over the course of a few weeks) she'll watch ahead a few episodes while I'm at work and end up finishing the series quite some time before me. On a few occasions she has done a similar thing with a movie and watched one we were planning to see with her friend prior to us going. Something about this drives me up the wall and, for me, takes away from the experience of watching it together. I've asked her to stop doing, but she hasn't. Is this a normal thing to be annoyed with or am I overreacting about it?

POST: I realize that this is a question that is probably asked a million times, but it's something I'm struggling with - 

For a couple years, I've been in an on and off relationship with a guy who hasn't met my needs, hasn't made me happy and spends most of his free nights getting drunk, alone. There is no rational reason that I should still be pining after him -- but here I am. He's manipulating, awkward, mean... I honestly can't think of very many reasons to be heart broken, but I am. I'm not in love with him and I don't want to be with him, but I do miss him and it hurts that he's dating other people.

TITLE: Me [20 M] with my friend [20 F], her attachment issues.
POST: To put it bluntly, my good friend of four years has somewhat of an attachment problem with those she's been in a relationship with. 
She's still missing a guy she dated over a year ago, along with two others she'd dating in-between then and now, and it just sucks seeing her down in the dumps about it instead of flourishing and finding someone better. I wish it was as simple as telling her she needs to move on, but it is not. 

So I guess what I'm really asking here is, how should one deal with overattachment? I don't expect there's a simple fix, but is there any sort of wonderful advice I could send her way? I'd appreciate it.

she on the other hand is not very emotional at all. she doesnt talk a ton about how she feels and keeps everything to herself mostly.

when we talk, sometimes ill go off on a rant about how i dont like what shes doing and how she doesnt talk to me and that i miss her..and i can tell, im starting to overreact at that point.

i need advice on how to be less clingy and be ok with space, if anyone could talk to me about this thatd be great.

i also have a big problem with anxiety because of when i was younger so maybe im letting that come out again which is bad. anyway, help is appreaciated.

TITLE: Does my friend have LEG CANCER?!
POST: My friend and I were about to go get some food at 11 PM when he was resting his legs on my own. I was resting my hand on his leg and felt a weird bump below his kneecap. Upon lifting his pants-leg (which was totally fucking gay) and looking at it, closer inspection revealed that it was a mass of bone.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

So.... Anyone want to tell him that mass of bone isn't normal / tell us what it is? I'm aware of the Kneecap and the smaller kneecap-like bone behind it that helps facilitate movement, but this is below his kneecap, IE his leg doesn't run smoothly down, it has a jagged ridge of bone below his kneecap for a few inches before evening out.

Any ideas what it is?

POST: So I have a fear of commitment when I enter into relationships. This is the main reason none of them have worked out. Last night I was laying in bed thinking and I think I know where it stems from.

I feel that my fear of commitment is more deeply rooted by my fear of failure. I fear giving 100% of myself to something, only to have the possibility of failure (rejection). If I don't commit 100% to the relationship, it is much easier for me to move on if there is a break up (there always is). 

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

In all do honesty, his current music isn't what we're all fans of, but keep in mind, he's young. He can't sing about dramatic life experiences, breakups, or heart ache, because he hasn't experienced that yet.

POST: So, I've been with my SO, Katie, for 5 years, going on 6 this November and I feel like I don't know how to talk to her any more. Whenever we talk lately, our conversations just end up being about how work was that day, and then that's really it. I don't think it can be attributed to anything happening in our relationship, since we haven't fought about anything in a long while and there hasn't been anything that would seem to cause any kind of distance between us.

I'm not sure if it's a problem in our relationship, or if it's just me not knowing how to carry a conversation. I really want to be able to talk to her, but on the same hand I don't really know *what* to talk to her about. 

So I guess what I'm asking is not only how do I talk to her, but what exactly do couples ""normally"" talk about?

One of my friends said that if something is given under the agreement of a gift and then it is taken back, that can be considered property theft.  I know so little about all this, but I can't help but feel it's wrong (at least on a moral level).  Is there any legal backing, or is my grandfather just out of luck for accepting gifts?

Lately, I cannot stop thinking about all the events that happened last year. I have been looking at divorce more and more. I cannot get these thoughts out of my mind. We don't really have any relationship problems, but I do not think we are compatible romantically. We don't have many shared interests and don't have conversations unless it is about work or some family gossip, etc...

Please give me some advice. Do I start the divorce process or do I stay in the relationship that I don't feel will last much longer.

TITLE: She (21/F) left me (23/M) for not being mature or a man. I need help.
POST: Alright so she left me on Friday and said ""I can't be with you right now, I probably shouldn't be with anyone right now"" There seems to be a chance that we could get back together if I prove myself to her. I've gotten my friends input and they all said to move on, but I believe she is worth fighting for and I have no idea how to show her my worth.

She felt bought because I sent her three packages over the course of the relationship, One for christmas, one because she wanted to play Monster Hunter, and the third was some monster hunter figures and a LED Portal core and she felt alone in the relationship because I didn't support her when her aunt was put into the hospital and for other times when her family was being evil. 

I'm seeing a therapist and talking with a lot of my friends. Any ideas how to win back her affections with out making her feel bought?

Problem is, there really is a massive difference between us, for example she is very into drugs and generally lives life on the edge whereas I am against them and fairly boring.

What's the right thing to do? Cancel now so she doesn't get her hopes up, or go ahead with it whilst trying to keep an open mind by essentially knowing the outcome and then having to tell her it's a definite no?

TITLE: [16/m] Broke up with my [16/f] long-distance girlfriend.
POST: OK, so here's the deal. About a month ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, we were doing the whole long-distance thing. In the moment I was completely taken by emotions,(hormones too.) and I told her how much I cared for her, even told her I loved her.(First time I've ever said that to a girl.) In response, she told me she didn't feel the same anymore, and she just wanted to be friends.

She had started to become distant weeks before, and I knew it wasn't working... Anyway, several days ago, she sent me a email, asking to talk on Skype. So I accepted, and the next day we talk. All she wanted to do was have small talk. I was fairly offended, and cut her off, and logged off. At this point, I'm not really sure what I should do next. And I was hoping Reddit could give me some ideas, or whatever.

TITLE: PSA: Buying a kid's bike isn't just about the wheel size.
POST: I thought the wheel size was the only measurement that mattered.

Learned the hard way that's not the case.

No one ever talks about ""crank arm length"" -- the length of the arms that the pedals are connected to. And the length is pretty damn important. They are generally measured in millimeters, and the 170mm crank arms that came on my kid's 20"" bike are as long as those on my adult bike. (Apparently this is a thing on BMX bikes, this bike wasn't clearly billed as such)

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

Trying to find replacements, but these aren't parts generally designed to be replaced on cheap bikes. So now it's one of those situations where attempting to save money is probably going to cost more money.

POST: So, after 5 months she figured out she likes girls. She's been thinking about that for a long time and after meeting a certain girl, she decided she is more happy with girls rather than boys.

Now, the problem is that I lost a soul mate. She is the first to understand my problems, first that I opened up to, not just as a girlfriend, but as a person. She knows more about me than my parents. All that I had planned is now lost, I am lost, I don't know what to do and how to deal with this. I am too emotional to just forget some one that I loved with all of my heart, and even tho she did all of this to me, I still love her and care for her.

She was with her ex for 16 years and raised his children. They have a vehicle loan together, she still has mail going to his home, and hasn't taken all of her belongings yet either. She still texts him often but will act surprised that he's texting her if I'm wary of it happening.

Am I wrong to think that it's just a matter of time before she rekindles things with her ex?

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company.

I am working out more and actively making new friends and things like that but this is not about moving on. 
My real question is how do i meet more people, and of course meet more gals. I do not drink (ever) so bars are not much help (nor are they really my scene) and all i really have is my work at a barnes and noble and home.

This upset me...a lot. I know we're not exclusive and we're just dating right now. Am I wrong to feel bad? Is she wrong for going on another date with someone? She knows how I feel. She feels the same. She doesn't want to jump into anything serious so soon. She says she wants things to happen on their own and not force them so early. 

I've been out of the dating game for a long time and I really like this girl. I don't know what to think anymore.

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

TITLE: Any tips for two introverts moving in together?
POST: My boyfriend [23M] and I [21F] are thinking of moving in together at some point in the near future. We have been together 1 year and friends for about 5 years, so we know each other reasonably well. We are both quite introverted and are wondering if there is anything two introverts should know when going into a shared living arrangement.

For starters, we've agreed to have two bedrooms so that each of us can have our own space. We've also agreed to give the other person notice if one of us brings friends over. We're still talking about how to make sure each person gets enough downtime. Is anyone who has been in a similar situation able to share some perspective?

I was having sex with my ex boyfriend, missionary style, and we were getting really into it. My dog was asleep on the foot of the bed, but she usually paid no attention to us so we weren't concerned.

So, here's my issue: My girlfriend is still friends with her ex (they dated for 8 years) and they are in the same social circle. Whenever there is an outing, her ex is typically present. 

I have no issues whatsoever with my girlfriends ex, but I believe she does with me. She will not greet me or make eye contact. She basically pretends I don't exist and is normal around everyone else. 

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route. 

This is a pretty uncomfortable situation and I'm hopng for some mature tactics to change the situation for the better.

I've been dating a girl for the past 2 months which in my mind has surprisingly gone well, but I have yet to breach the question of what we actually are and what she thinks of me. I feel like I need to ask soon before I let myself actually fall to hard for this girl.

Some of my concerns are that she broke up with her EX in January and I'm kind of nervous to see if she's still attached and don't know how to comfortably breach the question. 

Additionally I've had to make all of the plans and always initiate texting, which sometimes takes her hours to respond to, and coming from an awkward guy this always gets me second guessing.

I see many of my former classmates confirming their attendance, all so excited about it. ""I""m going, PLUS ONE!"" Congrats on your marriage, I really don't care.

I've been officially dating my girlfriend for almost three months. Before this we were hooking up for about a month before we put a title on it. I've dated before, but never have had a relationship as serious as this. This is my first ""serious"" relationship, and i'm not trying to rush anything. This girl just continues to blow my mind.

POST: Everyone on here is always giving good advice so I was hoping to poll you guys as well. Here's my issue:

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone. When I first got him, about a week ago, I was taking him out every 2-3 hours but could rarely get him to goto the bathroom. Instead, he just comes inside walks around my apartment for 10 minutes and then goes. I've tried every hour on the hour as well. It's been a week now and he's consistently doing this no matter how long we take him out for. We went on a nice long walk yesterday (thanks to warm weather) and he barely sniffed the ground. But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times. What am I doing wrong? Any tips are appreciated!

POST: When my dad was growing up, his father used to come home from work and would try to entertain them with different little toys and other things he would bring with him. One of the things my dad always told me was his favorite was a lightbulb that my grandpa would put into his mouth (Not the large end, mind you, but the actual part you would screw in) and somehow light it up. He would let them touch it and look at it, but they couldn't find a switch or anything that would light it up. They still have no idea how it worked and my grandpa died about 15 years ago. 

Does anyone know where I can find one of these, if they exist still, or how they work?

Thank you!

But a friend was saying she might be nervous about talking to me because she may like me, or just cuz I'm a boy. She is the shy type, after all. Personally I'm banking on the latter. :/

So, this reaches out to teen (or once teen) girls. What are the REAL signs that you are interested in a boy? Or is this just all about the girl herself? I always hear things about her looking at you and looking away when the guy sees them. Ya know, typical things.

TITLE: [20/m] slow moving relationship, how to avoid friendzone?
POST: Been dating this girl recently for almost a month and everything has been going pretty smoothly. Girl seems to be on a conservative side/seems to want to take it slow. I'm fine with that, but I want to avoid heading into the friendzone. We've already had our first kiss(after 2 dates), but not our first makeout session if that makes any sense. We've been holding hands ever since we first started to, but my friend had told me about how he too had been hand holding this girl and things just never escalated...

I feel like I should try to escalate more, but I don't want to be pushy due to her seeming like she wants to take it slow...I've tried steering the conversation before into something sexual but it didn't work(she didn't seem like she wanted to talk about it) so I gave up.

POST: I recently discovered my boyfriend lied to me at the beginning of the relationship. He claimed there was never anything between him and this friend of his. I overheard her say something halfway into the relationship, over the phone. Something you don't say to a friend. I don't think he cheated though.

I was snooping on his computer, something he would possibly break up with me over. I found that he had said he met this ""awesome girl"" around the time he met her. This has left me upset and I feel betrayed. It was a post he made on here over two years ago, before I met him. But still. He lied to me.

He knows that this is an issue because my ex cheated with a girl he liked before he met me.

So when I got home and saw my partner I looked her straight in the eye and said 'oh god, I got bit by a spider last night when I was walking to the shops!'. I felt so incredibly guilty and horrible for it. But she somehow believed me.

We broke up shortly afterwards because I couldn't stand the fact I was cheating on her, and because we were all kinds of wrong for each other. But that is another story.

So reddit. What's the biggest lie you've ever told.

Because of the size of the stations and going from bus to subway or subway to train, there is quite a distance to walk and I want to cover it quickly.

Now, I'm fairly tall compared to most people in this country and hence I walk with a large stride. I also walk quite quickly (much to my wife's annoyance haha).

But what irks me to the upmost is when these little people with their short legs cut me off and walk slowly in front of me, especially when talking loudly (they are like macaws here) to their friends or on the phone. So my petty revenge for these people is to either step, heavily, on the back/heel of their shoe or kick underneath their shoe so they take an extra large step.

The look of pain/surprise is amazing.

POST: **Disclaimer: we're both Gay**

My boyfriend and I just had a fight. Basically, I'm not comfortable with him cuddling with his friends, because of the potential sexual/intimate connotations attached to it. For context: I have a diaper fetish and like to use pacifiers and other baby items at times. 

He allows me to continue to do this despite the fact that it makes him uncomfortable; citing the fact that he loves me and trusts me enough not to take it too far.

However, I've posited to him that the difference between my choosing to wear diapers and his choosing to cuddle with this friends is that what I choose to do involves only myself as an individual; whereas his cuddling involves another individual.

He is now saying that if he can't cuddle with his friends, then I can't wear diapers.

TITLE: What are the pros/cons/potential pitfalls of adopting a data-only VoIP smartphone plan?
POST: The long story short is that I want to upgrade my phone but in the long run it will cost me hundreds (perhaps thousands) of dollars to do so because I would have to give up the unlimited data plan I have right now. The desire to save money has fueled my research to find a different solution, and recently I stumbled on this article: 

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

TITLE: Counting Calories and Exercising?
POST: Hello all.

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off? For example, I know most males aren't supposed to eat fewer than 1500 calories a day, and when I do (or did, should I say) the weight loss just isn't as prominent (not to mention that at below this point, the body's chemicals start to unbalance).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

So I am 22 years old, and just got my first job out of university (yay!) 

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

I live in Ontario, Canada by the way.

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?

I feel that my fear of commitment is more deeply rooted by my fear of failure. I fear giving 100% of myself to something, only to have the possibility of failure (rejection). If I don't commit 100% to the relationship, it is much easier for me to move on if there is a break up (there always is). 

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: Alright so, this Sunday, I have the opportunity to go check out my potential second dog (Border Collie, working lines). I've never encountered puppies younger than 8 weeks, and I am kind of hoping to ""gel"" with one above the others to make my final decision easier. But! I have read that the ideal time to test these things is at 49 days. Any younger and it *could* change my judgement.

Have any of you had an experience with picking out your pup at 4 weeks, when visiting the litter? Was their behavior and likes/dislikes consistent with what you ended up getting at 8 weeks? I'm not paying attention to looks at all - the only thing I want is a pup who enjoys toys, play, and has a lot of potential drive to tap in to.

POST: So, I (22F) recently met an a guy (22M) who's in the Air Force. We've been talking for about 3 weeks now and things are going pretty smoothly. He's nice, funny, and really sweet. Although I only see him on the weekends (he has a curfew), he goes out of his way just to make me happy and does the sweetest gestures. 

Anyways, he's going to be stationed in Italy for 2 year within the next 3 weeks. He asked me to be his girlfriend but I'm not sure what to do. He's never had a real girl friend so I'm worried that he won't accept me for who I am but rather the idea of who I could be. Plus, long distance will be very hard because I feel like the only way long distance works is with a strong foundation and we don't have that yet. 

I guess what I'm asking is should I give him a chance or should I just move on since he's moving away?

TITLE: How can I get my live-in landlord to change his rules without causing tension?
POST: So, this person is exceptionally difficult. There are a bunch of annoying rules he's imposed post-me moving in, he's probably the stingiest person I've ever met, and he's decided that it's acceptable for the heat to be at 5ºC when no one's home, 10ºC when sleeping, and 15ºC when someone's home and awake (41, 50, and 59ºF, respectively) thus resulting in me being fucking freezing always. I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June. The most annoying part about it is that he goes about telling me the rules with a ""that's the way things are"" attitude, and like, I understand it's his house, but I'm paying rent, damnit. And a third of utilities.

POST: Last year I (23/M) struck up a friendship with a married coworker (20s/F).  We both had some issues going on in our lives and it felt really good to have someone to talk to.  It stayed friendly for a few months until we both admitted that it was starting to become more than a friendship.

Neither of us were interested in having an affair but after another month we started spending a lot of time together.  Eventually she felt that we should have some space from each other, which I reluctantly agreed with.  Looking back now I see that it was the right decision but at the time it really hurt.  I've done my best to keep my distance, but things have been awkward since then because I still feel strongly about her.  I know that it's best for her to stay committed to her marriage, but I'm just having a really tough time moving on from how I feel.  Any advice is appreciated.

POST: My girlfriend is having a lot of emotional issues lately. She calls me nearly every night deeply upset, it usually takes me an hour or two to calm her down. She wants to seek medical help, meaning a therapist, or a counselor of some sort. Her parents have agreed sort of, but have taken no action. I am worried because it has gotten to the point to where she is severely depressed and thinks about hurting herself and throwing up sometimes because she doesnt feel good enough, she just as of a few months ago got over a eating disorder. I want to get her the help she needs but i obviously cant pay for it by myself. I dont know what i can do.

TITLE: How do you keep the interest going in a relationship? How do you get over being only interested in the ""chasing"" part?
POST: I've had a problem since I started dating, I lose the interest in the other person as soon as I know how they feel about me. I can obsess over someone for months but when the other person gets close BOOM all the feelings disappear. 

I can't really believe they weren't true feelings in the first place because it' not just a matter of weeks, sometimes it can be years. And I don't get over it only by sleeping with the person, sometimes it's just a kiss or a declaration that makes it go away. 

So I'm tired of acting like a bitch, because yeah that's kind of the word that describes acting like you're madly in love and the next day forgetting the person. But really it's not deliberate. I'm really into the person and then intimacy shows up and I can't deal with it. I try not to show it but of course at some point it's obvious.

While friendly, she isn't flirty, responsive to my flirtations or has been warm towards me at all.

Of course she could have cold feet as it's a one month old relationship, but that's just me being negative.

The boss notices my history and experience working in the field of IT. He informs me that they also need someone at the company to support the few desktops and servers that they have.

The starting pay for the Marketing position is $15/hr. Now that I passed my probationary period and they offered me the fulltime position, is it reasonable to ask to renegotiate my salary since they added Desktop and Server Support to my daily job duties? And if so, how can I come about doing that respectfully?

I have been with my GF for 7 months soon.
I'm her first ever boyfriend and first guy she's even dated.
She has told me she loves me and I've told her the same, and I truly thought we both meant it.
In the past 3 - 4 weeks we have been constantly fighting, she seems to be attacking me on little things at every turn and no longer making seeing me a priority.
I understand that she has her own life and that outside of me but recently we have gone from seeing each other 3 - 4 times a week to 1 - 2 and she doesn't seem to be really upset by this.

Both of us are dealing with things outside the relationship and letting it interfere with how we are around each other a lot as well but I feel like that's nothing new for a lot of couples. 

We have tried talking about it and it just ends in a fight and her shifting the responsibility on to me.

My birthday came a couple days ago, and that evening I checked my email to find he emailed me saying ""Happy Birthday"" (subject line, no text in the body of the email). I responded and said ""Thanks. Sorry I forgot about yours [his had been a month prior]. Hope your birthday was enjoyable and hope you're doing well."" He hasn't responded.

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: I have tried the obvious: eye contact, coy smile, dressing nicely. I make jokes and laugh at jokes. I am female and not unattractive.

Things are going really well so far, we both love each other and I couldn't be happier, except for one thing. Im not sure if were compatible together long term. She see's herself living in a warm climate in the future, and I like it here in the northeast. She wants to live in the country at one point in the future and I like the suburbs. She isn't sure she wants her own kids (maybe adopt) and I think I want my own kids in the future. She doesn't see herself living in one place her whole life, and I have a family job I might need to not move far away from. I love her and am really happy, but should I end things sooner rather than later and be even more emotionally invested?

I read an askreddit post about communicating with girls on /r/gonewild, and that most people thought this was worse than simply viewing porn, since you can private message the girls on gonewild, and possibly chat with them.

TITLE: Me [24 M] dating [24 F] for about a month. She never texts firsts or initiates things. Should I be worried?
POST: Dating for about a month - things seem positive. We live far apart so we are seeing each other about once a week - usually for 4-5 hour dates. If it matters, we've kissed, but haven't slept together yet.

We have plans to go skiing for the New Year for a few days (we spoke about it and booked lodging) so I have to assume she must be interested since we will be spending a few days together alone.

However, I get a little worried at times because she never texts first, or initiates a hangout. I've gone 3-4 days without texting first, and I won't hear a thing from her. 

Is this something to be worried about? Is she thinking about me at all?  I know some people aren't big ""texters"" but still, you'd think she'd reach out every once and a while, right? 

Hard to wrap my mind around it.

TITLE: Concerns about Sertraline
POST: Hi, so I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I visited a doctor a while back and she prescribed Sertraline for general anxiety and agoraphobia.  While I started the medication I experienced dry mouth,  which I was willing to sit with.   One day,  though,  I was getting out of the shower and became extremely confused, which really scared me so I stopped the medication. 

That was all before I started school.  Since this semester began I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety.   For a while I was handling that, until my grades started to fall.  After that I became unmotivated, lethargic,  and irritable.  

Now I'm debating going back on the meds because I've not been able to ""kick"" the depression.   My concern is that I might experience more of the side effects.  If I've already experience a few, does that mean I'll experience the others?

So, here's my issue: My girlfriend is still friends with her ex (they dated for 8 years) and they are in the same social circle. Whenever there is an outing, her ex is typically present. 

I have no issues whatsoever with my girlfriends ex, but I believe she does with me. She will not greet me or make eye contact. She basically pretends I don't exist and is normal around everyone else. 

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route. 

This is a pretty uncomfortable situation and I'm hopng for some mature tactics to change the situation for the better.

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract).

TITLE: Which State Tax(es) do I Pay?
POST: Hi /r/personalfinace,

I have a question regarding state taxes, and I cant seem to get a definite answer.

As a college graduate of June 2015, I searched and interviewed for multiple positions before accepting a position in New York state this past February. However, part of the hiring process is a 6-9 month temp period which I'm currently 4 months in to. The temp agency I was referred to is in northern New Jersey, which is where I also live.

My question is: Do I pay both New Jersey and New York taxes, or just New Jersey? I've asked the other temps in my group as well as the temp agency itself and still do not have a definite answer.

I am currently only paying New York state taxes and this doesn't seem right. 

Thanks!

I am a programmer from the DC area.  My wife is going to start grad school next Fall, so we will be packing up and moving to LA at the end of this summer (August/September... about 6 months from now).

**Problem:**

I'm afraid that my inability to start the job until the end of this coming Summer will disqualify me from most jobs currently available.

Do I apply for jobs now or wait (if so, how long)?  On one hand, I want to start applying now so I can have a job secured before I get out there.  On the other hand, I don't want to disqualify myself by applying to positions too soon.

POST: I love her and this is not, **repeat not**, a deal-breaker but I'd like her to be more feminine. She grew up basically feral, has no female relatives any less feral, and is too embarrassed to talk to her friends.
Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

POST: Here is the story. A female and I are friends for 2 years.  Over the years, we gave each other clues we like each other more than friends but nothing came out of it.  

3 weeks ago we were hanging out. A lot of bottles of wine was consumed between us,and we started to make out for the first time.  Making out as in a lot of kissing with tongue, hugging and touching of bodies of the non sexual parts. About 30 minutes in, she said ""I want to feel you."" Initially I thought this as having intercourse but wasn't sure. i asked, ""you mean have sex?""

Apparently me asking this killed the mood for her. I don't feel I was wrong for asking because we were both still pretty buzzed and since I felt she was out if it, I had to ask. No intercourse happen that night but would you, as a female, feel rejected or have any other negative feelings based on my actions?

POST: Hey all - looking for advice on how long to wait for official paperwork to be emailed? 

My situation: Interviewed with CEO and another executive with company. Received a phone call Friday after hours from the executive who said I got the job and paperwork would be coming this week. I have to put in my two weeks at my current job, and they understand that my start date will be the 19th. 

However - I don't want to put in my two weeks until the offer is signed, sealed, delivered in writing. Still waiting on the offer via email. 

Am just looking for advice on how to handle this situation? Should I call them/email them just highlighting my scenario about putting in two weeks respectfully? 

Am just very worried this verbal offer will be rescinded or revoked because I'm overanalyzing this situation over and over. No background checks or anything required for this job.

POST: I'm headed off to a summer camp next week, where I'll most likely meet a girl I now have a big crush on. I met her last year and got her phone numer, so we talked a little but I stopped texting because I'm dumb and figured she probably wasn't interested, lived over an hour away, and was most likely headed to a different school for college. Now the camp is about to start again and I just found out we are actually headed to the same college!

 I'm super excited to see her again, but I'm afraid there will be awkwardness between us because we stopped talking (again, i'm *really* stupid) and also because i'm naturally quiet around people i'm not familiar with. 

So, my question is; What can I do to make sure my interest in her is clearly communicated considering my past encounters with her?

We've been talking frequently and we both know that we like each other (will elaborate shortly)
Recently, we've just been talking less and less to the point where I end up waiting hours for a reply from her OR I end up abandoning my previous message and sending a new one entirely.
This is made worse by the fact that my mind has a tendency to make a mountain out of a molehill and think of worse case scenarios that just make me get upset and all that other bullshit.
I told her yesterday straight forward that I like her, to which she told me the same & that she wanted to see how things go, yet nothing has changed (still waiting on a reply to a text I sent 4 hours ago + a text i sent 20 minutes ago)

TITLE: Does my friend have LEG CANCER?!
POST: My friend and I were about to go get some food at 11 PM when he was resting his legs on my own. I was resting my hand on his leg and felt a weird bump below his kneecap. Upon lifting his pants-leg (which was totally fucking gay) and looking at it, closer inspection revealed that it was a mass of bone.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

So.... Anyone want to tell him that mass of bone isn't normal / tell us what it is? I'm aware of the Kneecap and the smaller kneecap-like bone behind it that helps facilitate movement, but this is below his kneecap, IE his leg doesn't run smoothly down, it has a jagged ridge of bone below his kneecap for a few inches before evening out.

Any ideas what it is?

Gradually (pre-move) he became less focused on me and more so on the move. I couldn't expect anything less. Lately, it seems like environmental factors have been influencing him more frequently (forgets to call me back, fewer intimate conversations, ect.). He's easily distracted, and generally a reserved person. What can I do to help him open up to me without being overbearing?

TITLE: Letting down a friend
POST: Me: 19. Her: 18. Both of us are college freshman and we've known each other since the beginning of last semester. We hang out most days in a group of five (4 girls including her and myself).

Over the past few months I've been picking up on a few things that lead me to believe that she likes me, and I fear it may be reaching a critical point at which it will need to be confronted. The most recent signs have been things that mutual friends have said (most telling is ""You know she loves you"").

Thing is, I see her as a friend only, with no romantic attractions at all. So what I'm looking for is a way to let her down softly when the time comes without having to jeopardize our friendship.

If I tune an instrument, according to the tuner, I have tuned it too high by just a bit. Everything is sharp.

I just found out there has been 5000 texts back and forth with a semi-friend who is a guy. There have been other clues as well.

We have a significant amount saved and I own a home business. We are in a no-fault state in the US.

I no longer like her and have not for quite a while and do not want to spend my life with her. 

She's still in the house, but about to move out.

How do I handle the humiliation with our friends and community? Like they always say, ""The husband is the last to know"". I think a lot of people may know and it is extraordinarily embarrassing to think what they are talking about.

And so with Kelly's wedding a month away, Sarah and I are trying to piece together a speech, with zero ideas. It's just a really awkward situation. Any advise on how to do this?

I've budgeted out the next year based on my minimum income with no commission.  This plan sees me debt free by August 2016.  All of my expenses are covered, and any commission I receive  moves my debt-free date forward.

The budget factors in savings, my HSA, and my simple IRA to get my employers max contribution.

My question is, now what?  All I do is eat, sleep, work, gym, and repeat.

TITLE: Is it wrong for professors to grade on handwriting?
POST: Let me start this off by saying that [I have dysgraphia] aka, my handwriting just isn't that good and there's nothing I can do about it.

In the past I've had a few professors try to comment on my handwriting, but I've always made sure to let them know that there really is little I can do about it. 

Unfortunately, I told one of my professors about it recently as he was calling me out in front of the class over my bad handwriting, and he said ""Dyscrapia? What's that, something you made up? hahaha"". 

I mean, I tried to explain it's a real thing, blah blah blah, but that shit is pretty insensitive to call me out in front of the whole class simply because my handwriting isn't up to par, let alone the fact he told me he was going to stop collecting my work if ""You don't start writing better.""

Note, this was not an English teacher or anything of the sorts, it was an engineering class.

POST: After reading ""The Giver"" in 6th grade, it's always stuck with me. Once or twice a year I'll give this book a read. The ending has always struck me as powerful, because you're left with a kid who's run off and at this point has no one, dying in the snow. In his dying moments he hears music in front of him, and maybe behind him, as a sign of his ultimate sacrifice in order to bring color to the world. I've always seen it as a strong, poetic ending and I think it's shaped much of my philosophy in life. For reference sake I'm now 27.

Spoiler alert. Then I had to go and read books two and three and find out that the kid from The Giver's not dead at all. He went and became leader of another dystopian future-town (that I guess has been inundated with the horrors of capitalism through the Trade Mart?)

I was confused and so upon returning to the hotel I asked the person at the front desk what I did wrong. Apparently ""Vendisi"" means ""For sale"" and I asked it in a tone that seemed more a question. In other words I accidentally just asked beautiful women if they were prostitutes and for sale...

POST: I know this is beyond dumb, and I know that height is simply a physical trait.... I can't help but want someone tall. I don't like the need to bend down so much to hug, or even interact with that person as its just too much of a strain/pain in general.

That being said. I live in Toronto, and I don't see any tall women at all. Before any one asks, I consider tall to be 5'10""+ as heels do make a difference if they were to wear them which isn't mandatory for me at all.

I've tried online dating, and I had some luck finding taller women but no one I was attracted to.

POST: Hi there,

I'm starting my senior year in college, and have got a decent chunk of savings from working during breaks/thanks to my (nearly) free tuition.  Right now, I've got almost $30,000 saved up.  I've accepted a job offer for next year for $100,000/yr, so I will be making a good deal of money and have no debt.  

My parents have said that I could stay at home after I graduate for saving up for house/apartment/whatever if I need to.  So, for that first year, I'll have nearly no expenses.  I will be working/living in Boston, MA, USA.

My issue is, I have zero knowledge of anything financial.  I don't know what is a good safe place for money, what do do for real estate (buy/rent), how having this money will affect me in terms of tax/what I can do for this?

POST: On Thursday, I was diagnosed with Aspergers. My family and friends always thought I was just anti-social and slow. 

Well, apparently I'm not. I'm just on the spectrum. I'm not having a hard time accepting it, because on some level I've always known. 

When I told my family, my dad asked what it meant - so I explained it to the best of my abilities. 

He then said to me: Oh, so you're half retarded. 

I just laughed it off initially, but it actually hurt my feelings a lot. 

I have no idea what to do from here. I live with them so NC isn't really possible.

TITLE: Is there such a thing as being too nice?
POST: Hello again /r/askreddit.

Story:

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

So I was wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, being mean sure doesn't sound like a good way of changing this.

POST: I went for an annual physical with a new doctor who is my PCP. She asked me if anything was bothering me and I told her I had a slight plain in my foot. The Doctor said to try stretching it and make another appointment if it keeps hurting. She wrote it down in my file and told me that was only to put down as much information as possible to justify the other blood tests she was running to the insurance company. 

Weeks later her office is charging me for two office visits for that one time because I mentioned having foot pain. Insurance paid for most of it but I have to pay the remainder. 

The doctor never told me at the time of the visit that mentioning pain would change the nature of the visit. Does this count as fraud? What should I do?

TITLE: Me [24 M] not sure if I should pursue a [24F]
POST: So I'm 24 and I'm talking to a woman who seems cool, we get on and share a lot in common. 
However she talks about how she gets bored in relationships easily and having her head turned also quite easily. 
Not cheating per se but lusts after other people I'm assuming. 
So she seems cool, but these traits aren't exactly attractive and I feel like it's going to just lead to a world of pain if I try to go forward with this woman. 

I have two questions, one is to people who do/did get bored of relationships easily, how did you overcome that if you even managed to?

The other question is to people who have dealt with someone with these issues before. How did you deal with them, did you manage to overcome them and have a succesful relationship? or should I not even bother? 

Thanks.

I have not yet graduated from my school, but I haven't been enrolled for ~15 months. I will remain a student until I independently finish this one last requirement and get cleared for graduation.

My mom may need to move soon, and she'll need to get a mortgage on a new house. She's also the cosigner on my (private) student loans, totaling ~$123k. With that debt hanging over her, she and her wife can't get a mortgage.

Consolidating my loans is something I've been intending to do regardless.

im very emotional and i know that but i think i do ok at giving her space, but then again, maybe not enough.

she on the other hand is not very emotional at all. she doesnt talk a ton about how she feels and keeps everything to herself mostly.

when we talk, sometimes ill go off on a rant about how i dont like what shes doing and how she doesnt talk to me and that i miss her..and i can tell, im starting to overreact at that point.

i need advice on how to be less clingy and be ok with space, if anyone could talk to me about this thatd be great.

i also have a big problem with anxiety because of when i was younger so maybe im letting that come out again which is bad. anyway, help is appreaciated.

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia.

TITLE: My [24,F] boyfriend [26] of almost a year very rarely kisses me... should I be concerned?
POST: Yes, we have talked about it.  He will give me quick pecks no problem, but we have never, ever ""made out"".  Kissing is super intimate for me and I can never get him to do it longer than 3 or 4 seconds before he is trying to get away.  

He claims (and I believe him) that he has a deviated septum and it makes it hard for him to breathe when kissing me, and that he finds kissing to be a bit unnatural and weird anyways.

Does this seem legitimate or like something I should push?  He is very introverted and not very intimate anyways, so it just sucks that I can't even really make out with him.  Maybe I'm being childish... but that's why I'm asking y'all.  Thanks!

Our relationship is lacking most things physical to say the least.  We hug and peck-kiss goodbye, but she told me she doesn't want to make-out or have sex yet, because she's been hurt before.  She says she's trying to get over this problem, and that she's in therapy for it.

I would imagine a page with collapsible categories and checkboxes to subscribe/unsubscribe would be much more user friendly. Is this feasible? I understand that there are many subreddits -- so you could only include ones with over 100 or 250 subscribers to narrow it down. Additionally, there could be a preference option to keep your subreddit out of the list if you so choose.

I understand that the admins are busy, which is why the title doesn't say ""For the admins"". I know Reddit has some decent programmers, and quite a few decent minds.

I recently discovered that my partner has a secret online persona which they use to engage in online relationships. These range from innocuous to cybersexual/planning to meet. My partner claims this is all innocent and simply a means of escape, I however feel deeply hurt.  My partner feels betrayed as well because a mutual friend sent me the screen shots of the aforementioned evidence. This I agree was a violation on their part of his trust.

TITLE: Is there any harm to getting only 6 hours of sleep per night? Can anyone provide encouragement or tips to switch to 6 from 8 hours?
POST: I've decided to try limiting myself to 6 hours of sleep per night. I have a decently long commute and if I try to get 8 hours each night, I limit myself to around 2 hours of leisure time per night, without exercise.

We always hear about famous and successful people who get by on 4 hours (Petraeues), 5 hours (Clinton), or whatever, so I figure there's no biological reason I can't get by on 6.

But when I only get six hours on my current regime, I'm exhausted all day. I'm worried that my work will suffer and I'll be a zombie.

Will the exhaustion last? Will I eventually get used to it?

POST: Context: I wanted to drink a nice cool beer, but I noticed that my all my alcohol was sitting in the middle of the living room. Naturally, I wanted to quickly chill my beer (for immediate consumption) so I threw a couple bottles in the freezer, and a couple more in the fridge. Well, I managed to forget about the two freezer bottles for a while, but when I took them out, they were thankfully unfrozen. I mean, these beers were confirmed for liquid tier. Anywho, I crack open one bottle, and as I pour it into my glass (and it poured just like any other beer would; it was not frozen in any sense of the word), it began to pile onto itself, and slowly turned into a beer slurpee. It had the exact texture of any slushy I've consumed previously. Can anyone explain what happened?

We broke up in October after I left for college and he stayed home. 

Since then there hasn't really been a clean break (still have flirted and hooked up when i'm home) but he has told me several times, ""I've changed, I want to be single and do my own thing. I still care about you and there's still a special bond, just not romantic"" 

It hurts every time. But I don't really want a relationship either. I just don't want to let go of the past, so I'm afraid of really breaking things off (no contact style) and not seeing him over the summer (even though he would still live in a different town, just closer)

I just don't know if it's worth the stress or if it's what I really want. It kinda makes me sick to realize how much I think about it.

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

He has more than one ulcer and now some if not all of them ruptured, and then he started to bleed out of almost every orifice and to make matters worse, the ambulance in my shit-hole of a country decided that they weren't going to send anyone. It took my neighbour's fire-fighter friend to get them to send one.

In that time, he had turned yellow, lost any semblance of control over his bowels and slipped in and out of consciousness, when he was awake he was delirious. This is after 2 hours of waiting. Now I am worried, my mother is with him and I'm at home ""holding the fort"".

TITLE: Counting Calories and Exercising?
POST: Hello all.

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off? For example, I know most males aren't supposed to eat fewer than 1500 calories a day, and when I do (or did, should I say) the weight loss just isn't as prominent (not to mention that at below this point, the body's chemicals start to unbalance).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

POST: I recently decided to be more thorough about losing weight. I was losing weight at a nice speed about a year ago, roughly 1lb a week. Then we had a baby and got all the weight back. The exercise I was mostly doing was on an exercise bike in front of my pc. I set up a playstation controller so I could cycle and play games and watch youtube videos and netflix. It works quite well and I usually spend 1- 1 1/2 hours on the bike.

And now on to the question. My bike says in my last cycle I burned 350 calories in 90 mins ( I know I cycle slowly. It's kinda in the background as I play or watch videos. It's usually about 10 - 13 mph). I just started on a website called sparkpeople and they list exercises and when I added the exercise as 90 minutes it said it should be 900 calories for exercise bike <12mph.

TITLE: [Sacramento, California] Renting a house. Water heater is old and insufficient, but not broken. Landlord's or tenant's responsibility to upgrade?
POST: Location: Sacramento, California, US

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

POST: We are teens been going out for just under a year. So yeah we are 'young and dumb' but I have recently started discovering the dark past of my girlfriend. She acted innocent and loving to me. But wasn't really that atal. So I discoverd the foundations of what we have are essentialy a lie.

We were single and taking things slow and I would only want after her, she said the same thing and I 100% belived it! Though I recently discoverd that she was some what... Well... Completely diffrent. Asking for shags and genrally flirting with every one including my best mate. The exact words were 'lets get drunk and horny' 

When I discoverd this I asked her about these convosations and metings, she bluntly denied them insisting she was the girl I fell inlove with but has since, over time admited-denied-admitted-denied these stores whilst changing vital parts every time.

TITLE: Which State Tax(es) do I Pay?
POST: Hi /r/personalfinace,

I have a question regarding state taxes, and I cant seem to get a definite answer.

As a college graduate of June 2015, I searched and interviewed for multiple positions before accepting a position in New York state this past February. However, part of the hiring process is a 6-9 month temp period which I'm currently 4 months in to. The temp agency I was referred to is in northern New Jersey, which is where I also live.

My question is: Do I pay both New Jersey and New York taxes, or just New Jersey? I've asked the other temps in my group as well as the temp agency itself and still do not have a definite answer.

I am currently only paying New York state taxes and this doesn't seem right. 

Thanks!

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes.

TITLE: Can I take HMRC to court for being late processing my return?
POST: It seems completely unreasonable to me that if I pay my VAT bill 12 hours late, I am fined almost 100% of the figure for doing so, yet I have just got my tax bill from 2009/10 (it was 40p!), nearly a year late and somehow it's OK for HMRC to just write a limp apology letter.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

 I'm someone who really had problems with their emotions and expressing feelings and she knows that, I feel like if I don't say I'm in love with her she's gunna just start even more of a fight that's gunna end up with us breaking up.

 Is this my problem, hers or a combination of both of us? How should I approach telling her I'm not in love with her without 
hurting her?

So when we got together after the Christmas break, things were sort of stilted and awkward. I figured something was up, so I didn't make any sort of advances and when she left after last weekend, things got even more distant. By weeks end, I asked her to talk about it and she admitted that she perhaps wasn't as ready for a relationship as she had professed.

That's fine, it is what it is... but now I'm having a bit of a rollercoaster trying to figure out how to rebottle the genie after having a conduit for the feelings I had for her. That said, she's one of the best friends I've had or could ever hope to have and to her, the friendship is ironclad... so if anyone has any thoughts on how I can quash the neuroses and get back into that stride, I'd appreciate it.

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone.

But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times.

POST: About six months ago I received a writ of garnishment for student loan debt (~$7000) for 15% of my disposable income. Not too bad on its own, but soon after the first writ, I received a second one from a hospital bill I was never served papers for, the garnishment being for a whopping 35% of my disposable income. The student loans are in the process of being rehabilitated and i know there's no way to get around it other than repaying. The medical bills are only for about $3000, but I cannot live on $250 every two weeks. It's definitely worth noting that I didn't contest either writ, because I didn't know how to go about doing so.

I told some serious whoppers in my time.

The week before my ex and I split, I spent some time at a hotel room with this guy I knew, anyway we hung out and..you know. Had sex.
Suffice to say my neck was covered in huge Hickeys that were EXTREMELY visible, and had turned into a dark red discolouration by the morning. 

So when I got home and saw my partner I looked her straight in the eye and said 'oh god, I got bit by a spider last night when I was walking to the shops!'. I felt so incredibly guilty and horrible for it. But she somehow believed me.

We broke up shortly afterwards because I couldn't stand the fact I was cheating on her, and because we were all kinds of wrong for each other. But that is another story.

I have not met here since then, but I will meet her tomorrow at another party. It is the final party of her exchange programm. Yep, she is an exchange student and will leave in 2 days...

But I kind of fell in love. I always think about her. Sometimes we are talking on facebook and she even said that I'm cute. (Don't know if that's much...)

Since I have a girlfriend for such a long time, I'm not really into these flirty things anymore tbh. What should I do, /r/relationships? **Tell her that I fell in love?** **Or is it better to not say anything?** I'm confused because I never thought I would meet someone that attracts me more than my girlfriend.

TITLE: Just received a major guilt trip from a friend (Details inside). What's the biggest guilt trip someone has taken you on?
POST: As for what happened today, I was asking some people in a Skype group how their days were going, and someone said that it was ""going alright."" I then proceeded to reply the same way, saying ""...but I need to do some homework and go to work today, though."" Next thing I know, there's a giant-*ss text wall on my screen going into great detail about how this guy's great-grandmother just died, and before that she didn't remember him, and his friend now hates him, and stuff like that. Now, I know these things are horrible, truely. However, the fact that he follows it up with ""But I think I aced some tests last week, though, so that's good,"" makes me think that he's just using it as a guilt trip.

TITLE: Do you have a book that you love, but are embarrassed to talk about?
POST: 2016 is the year of diversifying my reading life. What does this mean? Great question, I don't really know. At the end of last year I realized that I had read a lot of books (112 to be exact) but there wasn't much variety going on, I almost exclusively read history and literary fiction. I decided that was bonkers, and that I needed to expand my horizons. 

As part of this, I picked up Outlander by Diana Gabaldon as a romance pick and I thought it was AMAZING. I realized that I didn't want to talk about it to the group of friends that I usually talk to about books, because I was kind of embarrassed to have loved a ""romance"" book so much (about 2 days later I got over it and talked their ears off about it). 

I was wondering if anyone else had been in the situation where you loved a book but were to embarrassed to admit it?

TITLE: I [21/F] have this friend [21/M] who shows an interest in seeing me, but I'm not sure how to approach this.
POST: I met my friend three years ago in college. We had two classes together and hung out with other classmates at school so I would call him a loose friend. I haven't seen him since last Spring, but we text every now and then and he recently told me he had a crush on me. Almost every time we text he asks to see me, offering to buy my movie ticket or take me to a hockey game, which is all nice! but I have a boyfriend whom I've been with for 3 years (which my friend should know). I don't want to lead this guy on, but I also don't want to be a shit friend. He told me he ""had"" a crush on me, he never said he ""has"" which is why I *think* he just wants to be friends. What should I do?

TITLE: Me [28 M] with my wife [29F] two years, no anal-sex in bed. Got permission to seek it out there
POST: We enjoy sex very much, but one thing I love very much(anal) she doesn't. All my partners before marriage had anal sex with me. 

We are an open couple, my female friends join our bed occasionally on the weekend, or after few glasses of wine my wife like to watch me getting a blowjob. But Anal sex is off the table. 

She even offered I will look someplace else for anal sex, she just won't do it. 
I don't bring this issue up anymore for quite sometime, but I am very much into anal. I don't fuck around(unless my wife is watching). I want bought strap on so she I will try my ass and I will try hers. 
Off the table. 

What shall I do? I won't put pressure on her, but I really miss anal sex. Shall I go fuck around?!
I have no idea how to act....

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my girlfriend of 2 years [24 F], fighting often and getting sick of it
POST: My girlfriend and I met at the tail-end of college and everything was great. We fell in love, we were both happy and fought very little. Over the past 6 months, I've noticed our fights and unhappiness is coming more frequently. We both argue and constantly have to ask ""why are you mad?"" etc.

I know these are normal things in a relationship but when is it too much? She's depressed now about her day-to-day job and our sex life is not as passionate as it used to be. She almost never wants to do it anymore, and everytime we do, it's a chore for her. I find myself being annoyed by her over arbitrary things she'll say. 

How should I handle this situation? I love her so much but I don't know how to move my life forward. Is this something we can come out of and how will I know when if time to end it?

TITLE: Female Redditors, how important to you is it that a guy tells how he really feels about you face to face, as opposed to over text, IM, etc?
POST: Let me start by saying I am a really shy guy.
So long story short, I was at a party, got pretty drunk, and I ended up telling this girl that I like basically how much I am attracted to her. so the next day I apologized and told her that I wasn't in my right mind, I was drunk, etc.

Because I don't see her very often (I'm a first year and she's a second year, completely different faculties), a week later she sets me up gloriously to tell her again and I blow chunks out the ass; kinda laughing it off (some might say I'm a shy guy).

I now want to tell her for serious that I was embarrassed about my actions at the party, but what I said was true and that is how I feel about her. How important is it that I tell her this in person?
