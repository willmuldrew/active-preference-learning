TITLE: I'm in love with the guy I've been seeing and I don't think he feels the same.
POST: 19(almost 20) year old girl. I've been seeing this guy(21) for almost two months. He's funny, sarcastic, arty, and just pretty much everything I look for in a guy. The day after Christmas I realized I was in love with him. He's still bitter over his ex that cheated on him. Plus I found out he's been on Tinder still. I want to give him more time and not rush this. Its just really difficult when I'm ready to make it official and I'm having to stay alert to make sure ""I love you"" doesn't slip out. I always go to his place to hangout, but the other day he came to my house. So maybe he's more into me than I think? I just don't know. I dont want to rush it and scare him off, but I also want to share how I feel.

TITLE: Me 22F, want to end my vacation mid-way. Am I stupid?
POST: I planned this vacation six months ago and have been really excited about it ever since. It was a fifteen day solo trip across various cities of Turkey. It started amazing! Today is my third day in Turkey and I loved every bit of it.

However, I want to go back ASAP. I don't know why. Although my return tickets are booked for 6 January, but I have a bad urge to go back tomorrow or day after. 

I thought maybe I'm homesick, maybe I miss people or work. I'm not even bored. There's so much to do and see. Yet, I couldn't put my finger on it. But I'm sure I want to go back. It's just been three days and I'm restless. I can't enjoy the vacation when all the time I'm thinking about going back home.

I'm a mess right now. Please tell me what should I do. Should I go back or should I stay on and finish the vacation as planned?

TITLE: Fifth Third is holding my car hostage what can I do?
POST: Sorry...kinda long backstory. I recently bought a new, used, car. Unfortunately, the person I bought the car from had taken out a loan on the vehicle from Fifth Third. I paid him with a cashiers check (Supposedly as good as cash) and he went to the bank to pay off the loan. That is where the trouble started. Fifth Third said that since he was not paying off in cash they could not sign off on the title until Tuesday, which was the next business day. That's fine no big deal. So I go back to the bank today (Wednesday) to have them sign off on the loan and now they are saying it's a two week wait. Apparently since the loan was not paid off in cash they have a 2 week window. What can I do?? Fifth Third has the money and yet no one can drive the car.

Hi. I've been on Citalopram (Celexa) since May. 20 mg. For anxiety. I've been a student in Germany since 2009. Last month when I flew back home to India for a holiday, my doctor there replenished my medication stock for me. But he gave me a 6 month supply of Escitalopram (Lexapro) instead of Citalopram. Escitalopram is just the S enantiomer of citalopram, and apparently has better anti-anxiety effects. 

Today I finished my previous stock of Citalopram. Unfortunately, my doctor here near my flat is on holiday, tomorrow is All Souls Day which is a holiday too. The next appointment I can get is probably next week. Is it okay to switch to Lexapro? I mean, I have no other choice as of now.

TITLE: Me [24 M] dating [24 F] for about a month. She never texts firsts or initiates things. Should I be worried?
POST: Dating for about a month - things seem positive. We live far apart so we are seeing each other about once a week - usually for 4-5 hour dates. If it matters, we've kissed, but haven't slept together yet.

We have plans to go skiing for the New Year for a few days (we spoke about it and booked lodging) so I have to assume she must be interested since we will be spending a few days together alone.

However, I get a little worried at times because she never texts first, or initiates a hangout. I've gone 3-4 days without texting first, and I won't hear a thing from her. 

Is this something to be worried about? Is she thinking about me at all?  I know some people aren't big ""texters"" but still, you'd think she'd reach out every once and a while, right? 

Hard to wrap my mind around it.

I still have feelings for her for a friend of even further than that, but my main problem is I don't know how to talk to her.

POST: Greetings everyone! 

Two months ago I filled out a loan agreement with someone in the amount of $10,000 plus interest for a period of a month. The agreement was notarized saying that the borrower was to pay me back in a month. Well now they are past due 3 weeks entering the 4th. I have maintained email contact but when he went past due he stopped replying. Do I notify him that I have a demand letter ready one last time to see if he cooperates or do I just send the letter via UPS or FedEx already? 

He is a paralegal so I would think he has an idea how things work. Being that the small claims limit is $10k how can I sue him for the amount plus interest if it is over the limit?

That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract).

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia.

Reading the novel's introduction, it looks like this edition has about 500 extra pages. THAT IS CRAZINESS. The copy I have right now is 1054 pages. Holy crap, that much more got added -- wow.

**So has anyone read both the uncut and the much shorter original? If so, how do they compare?** I'm reading this now and just beginning to think ""this is long -- this is really, really long,"" and though I'm only 100 pages in a lot of these details don't seem that necessary. The whole introduction to ""The Stand Uncut"" basically is him saying ""this might be an indulgence."" Thoughts?

I need a bit of advice with my relationship. I met this amazing guy 7 months ago, I wasn't long out of a 5 year relationship that ended mutually and wasn't messy at all. After a few flings I met my current guy and things went really fast, We did the loveliest things for each other but it seems to have got really boring, we spend A LOT of time together because we live far apart so I stay at his a lot or vice-versa. Sex is always frequent and amazing but everything else seems to have stopped, the romantic gestures, thoughtful things and actually going out and doing things.

Should it be slowing like this, are we getting lazy and what are some fun couple-y things we can do with each other inside and outside the house?

 I've recently been hired at a small company as their ""Marketing guy"" meaning I will be updating their website, implementing their social media marketing, and creating brochures.

The boss notices my history and experience working in the field of IT. He informs me that they also need someone at the company to support the few desktops and servers that they have.

The starting pay for the Marketing position is $15/hr. Now that I passed my probationary period and they offered me the fulltime position, is it reasonable to ask to renegotiate my salary since they added Desktop and Server Support to my daily job duties?

POST: Ok so I started dating a girl three weeks ago that I had been friends with for the last 6 months or so. She just got out of a year and a half relationship with an emotionally manipulative guy about a week before we started dating. 

Today she texted me that she really cares about me and is scared that this will make me hate her but that she doesn't want to rush into another relationship so quickly and told me she needs some time to sort out her life. I asked her if this meant we needed to take it slower or if it was over and she said to give her some time before we start talking again. I told her that I would be here when she felt she was ready.

My question to you guys/gals is this, Is this relationship over for good or is there any hope for us?

Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

POST: So the other night, I was chilling in the car with a couple of my friends on a street a block away from my house. We were just talking when this car pulls up next to us. 

In the car were several, clearly drunk, guys and they start talking to us claiming we trashed their neighborhood. Obviously we're just like wtf and we're trying to talk to the guy when his friend from behind him gets out of the car and confronts me. Then as we're talking, he just sucker punches me. Now, I have a pretty short temper and have gotten into fights before but for some reason, it didn't really make me mad (maybe because the punch wasn't really much?). 

I actually smirked and we just said fuck it and we left. My friends asked why I didn't do anything and I really didn't know. Now I can't tell if I really don't care or if I'm just a pussy. What is it? Am I just being a bitch or am I ""maturing""?

I wish I could just move on myself but being the way I am, it's hard to meet new people and open up. Our son is 8 months old so things in the relationship moved rather quickly. I can help but feel worthless over this. I guess I'm not sure what to do, I've been trying and trying but every time I go to pick up my son it just gets harder and harder to see her. I'm afraid my son will think of her new boyfriend as his dad instead of me, even though I'm doing my best to see him overt day and take him over night. It just hurts so fucking much.

I can deal with spending time at her apartment fine, but I don't know if I can get used to the idea of my entire house constantly being like that and having no escape from the dog hair. Is it possible to have a relatively hair-free household with 2 dogs that shed a lot? If so, how? Would frequent professional groomings do the trick? I want to make this relationship work but I'm having a hard time getting past this.

In all do honesty, his current music isn't what we're all fans of, but keep in mind, he's young. He can't sing about dramatic life experiences, breakups, or heart ache, because he hasn't experienced that yet. As he matures, so will his music, and once that's combined with his talents he has the potential to be outstanding. 

So what does Reddit think, could Justin Beiber, potentially be the next Michael Jackson?

TITLE: [Sacramento, California] Renting a house. Water heater is old and insufficient, but not broken. Landlord's or tenant's responsibility to upgrade?
POST: Location: Sacramento, California, US

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

POST: I have had a number of close female friends where I have been unsure of their interests or intentions. I'm not looking for anything more than friends, but sometimes I get hints that they might be interested, or..I am reading too much into things.
For example, there is friend I have been hanging out with pretty often recently I haven't been sure of. She has a boyfriend she seems to like pretty well and often tells me about, but she also does things like push her breasts up on my arm while we were looking at a map together yesterday, and she always gives me a hug when saying goodbye. 
I think I've indicated I just want to be friends, but maybe I need to clarify?

TITLE: Idk if I'm being paranoid or not.
POST: Alright, so I've[25] started dating with a girl[23] from uni. It's all been fun and whatnot, but we were pretty cautious about calling ourselves a couple, both had some previous stuff mess up our heads. We've had a crush on each other since october, but started really acting on things ~2 months ago. Now, it has steadily evolved and we seem perfectly fine and happy and all that jazz, but recently I've been feeling that something's not right. Everything is seemingly perfectly fine, but for some reason I get the idea stuck in my head she's not as involved as she usually would. I wouldn't want to seem like I'm trying too hard or am too invasive too, which makes me unsure how to act. I have a history of overthinking and worry I might just be paranoid, which will lead me to trying too hard or something.

Any advice Redditors? I REALLY wouldn't want this one to go well.
