TITLE: My good deed for the day
POST: While doing one of our easier XC workouts today (300's at our 5k paces) i noticed some pain in the back of my knee similar to that of a pulled muscle, so I set off to visit the athletics trainer. It turned out that she had already left the school, so I dealt with it and returned to sit out the rest of practice. Getting to the point, while the slower group was going by on the track, I noticed that the last kid was falling behind a bit. As he was passing I decided to cheer him on a bit, and when I did he seemed to take note and kick things up a notch. Seeing his will to persevere and the fact that my words had motivated him, it made me feel accomplished despite my injury.

So I am 22 years old, and just got my first job out of university (yay!) 

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

I live in Ontario, Canada by the way.

In the past I've had a few professors try to comment on my handwriting, but I've always made sure to let them know that there really is little I can do about it. 

Unfortunately, I told one of my professors about it recently as he was calling me out in front of the class over my bad handwriting, and he said ""Dyscrapia? What's that, something you made up? hahaha"". 

I mean, I tried to explain it's a real thing, blah blah blah, but that shit is pretty insensitive to call me out in front of the whole class simply because my handwriting isn't up to par, let alone the fact he told me he was going to stop collecting my work if ""You don't start writing better.""

Note, this was not an English teacher or anything of the sorts, it was an engineering class.

TITLE: Me 19(m) with some questions about specific social circumstances.
POST: This may seem like a stupid question but please bare with me. Sometimes when I talk with certain friends of mine and I look at them intently, I eventually have to look away because I am uncomfortable with making eye contact because I don't want them to know that I think they are unattractive looking. 

So I have begun to notice that people also don't hold eye contact with me all the time and it got me wondering. Is that the most likely reason. I have a tendency to assume that others think the way I do and therefore I assume when others don't look me in the eyes it most likely is because I must also be unattractive.

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: Canada btw

Basically, 2 years ago (before I was with gf), this guy impersonated someone my gf was seeing at the time using a texting app and got her to send a nude photo of her. He knew both of them so he's not a complete stranger (identity still unknown though). A couple days ago a number messages my gf's friends phone asking for nudes, my gfs #, and my gfs nudes. I text it and manage to convince him it's my gf and he says he has a nude of me. I manage to convince him to send it to prove it was him, and sure enough it was. So now he's trying to get another picture out of my gf. Normally, I'd probably go to the police right now (after calming down a bit), but in my fit of anger, I told the guy to watch his back etc so im wondering /r/legaladvice, will I go down with him if I threatened him, even though he was (sexually?) harassing  my gf and her friend?

POST: I work in a environment where I have to prepare food for a company which is pretty dedicated to ergonomics (hope this is the right word). I also have to wear gloves while doing so. I have huge hands. Pinky tip to thumb tip is probably close to 13-14 inches and I have fat fingers. Anyways, they only supply medium and large gloves, neither of which fit and both of which results in uncomfortable cramping. Which has been getting worse even when I'm not wearing gloves. I've made management aware of this, and I know they can get larger gloves that fit me, but to save money, they won't. I don't want to sound like a whining little bitch, but is there anything I can do about this?

TITLE: Ex contacting dilemma
POST: I (23/f) left my first love (same age) when I was 19. It was long distance, we were both co-dependent and not trusting of each other. I think in the end we were both smothering each other. But i broke it off two years in. First kiss, first sex first everything. I never gave him closure.

Fast forward and I have been in a wonderful relationship for almost two years. I couldn't be happier. The problem is, and I know this sounds strange, but I keep having dreams (that do not correspond to any feelings in my normal life) in which I meet and have conversations and make amends with my first love - maybe like 3 times a week for the past couple months.

Going upstairs is usually a trouble for him, but yesterday and today after his walk he shot right up the stairs, while usually I have to coax him all the way. I believe this is a confidence issue for him because whenever he slips a little, which happens a lot, he whimpers than comes back down. He usually eats in the basement and sleeps there (dont worry its a nice basement) but we keep the door open so he can come up. Recently we moved his food and bed upstairs to the main level so he doesn't have as much stress on his hips going up and down, but when we walk him or take him to the bathroom we go through the basement.

POST: Location: Sacramento, California, US

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

If any redditors in the L.A. area need a PA, please please consider me. I'm a college grad with lots of multi-media knowhow (AVID, FinalCut, CS4) and I need steady work badly. I had a temp job with Google that lasted 2 years, and I assumed (wrongly) that it would look good enough on a resume to land me another job. I'm running on empty, I moved back home and it's clearly becoming a financial strain on my parents. I'll work infinite hours, and work hard. I'll start at the bottom and work my way through smiling. I have no ego, I have no attitude. I just want to work, earn enough to move back out, and get my life going.

TITLE: I [22/F] have an unbelievable amount of sex with my [25/M] brother every weekend and it is affecting family relationships.
POST: We have been doing this nearly every weekend since August. I go to his house on friday, get high and engage in extreme sexual activity until sunday. it's completely my fault - i pressured him to do drugs for the sole purpose of getting him to sleep with me. It has begun to affect our relationship as well as our relationship with our mother. 

I should also mention that our mother came by 2 weekends ago unexpectedly to drop something off while i was fully nude and dancing/shaking in front of my brother, who was on the couch and she saw me through the window. I ran into the bathroom and she just left. when i returned home, she was clearly upset and subtly let me know that my bro and i have been doing things.

 I know this is wrong but I genuinely enjoy everything we do. am i sick?

I told her yesterday straight forward that I like her, to which she told me the same & that she wanted to see how things go, yet nothing has changed (still waiting on a reply to a text I sent 4 hours ago + a text i sent 20 minutes ago)

She is really sad that her cousin is havng a big 50th celebration because she can afford it, and my mom cannot.

TITLE: Am I over Vanguarding?
POST: Everyone always seems to recommend Vanguard funds and when I did the research for quite a few things, their expenses really are significantly lower. The returns haven't been bad either. I'm wondering if when we talk about diversification, if that also means not having all my money with Vanguard funds -- here's how I'm exposed to Vanguard right now:

* 401k --> 100% Vanguard Target Retirement
* Roth IRA --> 80% VFIAX (Vanguard 500 Admiral) and 20% VGHCX (Healthcare fund)
* Regular brokerage for savings (extra savings) --> 90% VFIAX and some individual stocks for nostalgic reasons (<10%)
* 529 plan for kids --> Vanguard age-based option through my state's 529 manager

My employer luckily still offers a pension, which represents a bulk of my retirement savings and will be my primary source of retirement income.

TITLE: bf [22] responding to craigslist posts behind my [24] back
POST: I f[24] have been with my boyfriend [22] for about five months now. We began as a casual hook up and it slowly progressed into a relationship. During that time he talked to many other girls but there was no commitment between us so I wasn't too bothered. It did however, make me question how much I trust him because he rarely told me about these girls, even when we began to get much more serious. This fear was confirmed when I caught a glimpse of his email account. He had numbers emails from craigslist posts, and he had responded to many of them looking to meet up. I don't know what to do about this because I realize I shouldn't have seen his emails and because of this I don't want to admit that I violated his privacy. I'm at a total loss here on how to deal with it.

TITLE: Boyfriend (M20) has more or less lost his sex drive and I (M19) don't know what to do...
POST: So the title is a bit misleading... He's not my boyfriend, but its more serious than just FWB.  We've been together since last May, but took a 2 month break last summer (due to long distance) so we've been together for 9-11 months. Anyway, he seems to have recently lost his sex drive. We haven't had sex in about a month and I don't know what to do. Even when I try making out with him he either doesn't seem into it or participates for a bit and then just wants to sit there with me holding him. I have a very high sex drive, and I'm getting increasingly frustrated that my only release is masturbation (which is happening sometimes twice a day at this point, because it provides some release but doesn't really leave me fulfilled). We've talked about this a bit but it seems like nothing's changed since then. What should I do?

TITLE: Charles Schwab vs Vangaurd Target Retirement
POST: Long story short - I recently started investing into a Roth IRA account. To be specific a Target Retirement Fund that will mature over time as I grow closer to retirement age. Due to a recommendation from a coworker, I opened up the account through Charles Schwab and have already transferred an invested $3,000 into the Target Fund. 

However, I've since learned that Vanguard has an identical account as the one I chose through Schwab, and the fee's are less and the YTD returns are more. Here are the number differences:

*Charles Schwab 2055 (SWORX) Net Expense Ration 0.73% / YTD Earnings 2.97%
 

*Vanguard 2055 (VFFVX) Fees & Expenses 0.18% / YTD Earnings 6.95%  

My question is - how easy is it to switch from one fund to the other, and is it even worth the hassle?

POST: I just started ""The Stand,"" by Stephen King. Wanting to get the whole deal, I bought the uncut edition.

Reading the novel's introduction, it looks like this edition has about 500 extra pages. THAT IS CRAZINESS. The copy I have right now is 1054 pages. Holy crap, that much more got added -- wow.

**So has anyone read both the uncut and the much shorter original? If so, how do they compare?** I'm reading this now and just beginning to think ""this is long -- this is really, really long,"" and though I'm only 100 pages in a lot of these details don't seem that necessary. The whole introduction to ""The Stand Uncut"" basically is him saying ""this might be an indulgence."" Thoughts?

I was confused and so upon returning to the hotel I asked the person at the front desk what I did wrong. Apparently ""Vendisi"" means ""For sale"" and I asked it in a tone that seemed more a question. In other words I accidentally just asked beautiful women if they were prostitutes and for sale...

POST: Sorry about asking this again. I read like 20 threads and 20 articles about this issue, but a lot of them were either not really answered, a different situation, or some combination of the two. I know this question in the most repetitive questions thread.

To start off, the usual. Job A gave me an offer, I'd like to wait for Job B to offer. Job B still requires another interview at least.

The problem for me now is that Job B is much better than Job A. Job A is part time sales associate, Job B is full time in a different field I'd probably consider continuing. That makes Job B the ""dream job"", and I would definitely take it if offered.

Will a part time job even give me time to think about it? How do I ask them for that time without them just moving on with a different candidate. I also dont want to waste their time and mine by reneging.

TITLE: I [M/22] think figured out why I have a fear of commitment last night, and I want to know if its a reasonable diagnosis!
POST: So I have a fear of commitment when I enter into relationships. This is the main reason none of them have worked out. Last night I was laying in bed thinking and I think I know where it stems from.

I feel that my fear of commitment is more deeply rooted by my fear of failure. I fear giving 100% of myself to something, only to have the possibility of failure (rejection). If I don't commit 100% to the relationship, it is much easier for me to move on if there is a break up (there always is). 

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

What do you guys think? Is this fear of failure a common occurrence? Does it lead to fear of commitment? Personal stories are welcome! How did you get over it? etc...

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

POST: Let me start off by saying we dated over 2 years we broke up (his choice)  and we're having sex until about a week ago. He's been talking to this other girl for a few weeks and is about to date her so he went out and bought condoms with me there which kinda hurt my feelings but I let it go. 

A few days ago he got super upset bc I didn't tell him I went on a date... It didn't go too great do I never said anything. Then recently he got mad bc I said I missed having sex. 

I don't get how it's ok for him to buy condoms and leave things from his sex life everywhere but when I say one thing he's jealous/mad. 

Also I feel like if he really liked her he shouldn't care about what I'm doing am I right? I just don't get what he means by all this?

I noticed that during the week, when I'm watching TV or browsing reddit, I tend to get hungrier more often. I just want to eat when I know I shouldn't. But on the weekends I eat less than I usually do and don't seem to get hungry.

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

POST: The game I'am trying to find involves a cat and the point of the game was to place traps for the cat (needles is the only trap i remember).

I recently discovered that my partner has a secret online persona which they use to engage in online relationships. These range from innocuous to cybersexual/planning to meet. My partner claims this is all innocent and simply a means of escape, I however feel deeply hurt.  My partner feels betrayed as well because a mutual friend sent me the screen shots of the aforementioned evidence. This I agree was a violation on their part of his trust. However I feel like there was a much deeper violation of my trust when for the entirety of our relationship this has been occurring.

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off?

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

TITLE: My[17F] bf[7M] is getting braces and I'm wondering if it will take away from his appearance.
POST: My boyfriend is not 7, excuse my typo ha. 

So my boyfriend of roughly 6 months is getting braces in a couple of days, like I said, and I'm scared I'll find him less attractive. He doesn't have very crooked teeth as is and I really like his smile. He's already kind of dorky looking, in a way that I find extremely attractive ofc, so I think they'll enhance his dorkiness. I'm not gonna break up with him or anything if I think he looks weird. Just wondering if anyone else has felt that way? I know I'll probably just have to get used to him having them, he's probably going to have them for over a year. In addition, i know this can be an uncomfortable experience, what can I do to help him deal with the pain for the first few days? Is there anything I can buy him and stuff to make him feel better?

They said I was free to do with the red hat as I wished. Keep it, sell it, discard it, whatever. And they would send me the white hat I wanted at no extra cost. This, friends, gave me faith in humanity.

TITLE: M[19] just ended a long-distance relationship with F[17]. She wants to meet up as 'friends' next week.
POST: I broke up with my girlfriend after just over a year of seeing her last night. A couple of months ago I moved to uni over 2 and a half hours away and the long distance has effectively ruined our relationship. Neither of us were happy so I decided that it would be best to end it.

She is my first true love and we've experienced everything for the first time with each other, so letting go of that was very hard. She wants to see me as 'just friends' which would mean her coming up to stay with me for 2 days next week. I feel that this is either going to make this break up even harder, or that we will end up getting back together, only for us to have to go through this pain again at a later stage.
Is seeing each other a good idea, or should I tell her that I think it's best if we both had some space? Thank-you for any responses.

POST: My GF absolutely loves me. She wants to see me every chance we get, she constantly texts me, and I just know she loves me. I love her too. But she has emotional problems. She feels unloved and uncared for if I do something that will limit our time together. Example: I don't care about her because I recently took a job at a haunted house so I will not be able to see her as much. She gets extremely upset if I don't text her back quickly enough. She jumps to see who texted me when my phone goes off, to make sure it's not another girl. I tell her that she's being unreasonable for feeling unloved, and I'm the monster calling her names because she confided her feelings in me and i'm supposed to make her feel better.

Someone mentioned that I am spending a lot of time with the kid too soon. I understand he has no dad and I don't mind helping. I just think I still want to get to know the gf, since we barely have our alone dates.

I think we hang out 2-3 times with the kid and only one time at night with the gf which is usually Fri or Sat. Those nights aren't by ourselves either, they are with a group of our friends.

I don't want to tell her that I don't want to hang out with her kid, which I like but sometimes the dates are a little dull when he comes along. I do not want to hurt her feelings.

Also I need to mention, that its hard for her to get a sitter so he comes along.

I would imagine a page with collapsible categories and checkboxes to subscribe/unsubscribe would be much more user friendly. Is this feasible? I understand that there are many subreddits -- so you could only include ones with over 100 or 250 subscribers to narrow it down. Additionally, there could be a preference option to keep your subreddit out of the list if you so choose.

I understand that the admins are busy, which is why the title doesn't say ""For the admins"". I know Reddit has some decent programmers, and quite a few decent minds. Is anyone else interested in revamping the subreddit subscription method? I'm sure there are enough programmers here to start a community project.

I apologize for the rambling nature of this post.

Me and my girlfriend have a 1 year old female Cairn terrier. She knows basic obedience commands (sit, stay, come, heel, etc.) and does these commands pretty well when we are inside our apartment.

The problem comes when we take her outside to go to the bathroom or to take a walk. There are plenty of people / animals around our apartment and she gets crazy excited when she sees anyone. If there is no one outside she does decently well, but still isn't very responsive to our commands.

I also had a fake ID on me, and got nervous and hid it, but was fiddling with it, so he asked me if i had anything. I said no and he asked me to step out of the car. He told me he was going to search my car, and asked again if i had anything. I then told him that i had a fake id under the floor mat. He found it and said ""This is mine now"" but didn't write it on the ticket.

TITLE: How can I get my live-in landlord to change his rules without causing tension?
POST: So, this person is exceptionally difficult. There are a bunch of annoying rules he's imposed post-me moving in, he's probably the stingiest person I've ever met, and he's decided that it's acceptable for the heat to be at 5ºC when no one's home, 10ºC when sleeping, and 15ºC when someone's home and awake (41, 50, and 59ºF, respectively) thus resulting in me being fucking freezing always. I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June. The most annoying part about it is that he goes about telling me the rules with a ""that's the way things are"" attitude, and like, I understand it's his house, but I'm paying rent, damnit. And a third of utilities.

TITLE: Lexapro instead of Celexa. Can I switch? No option. GPs office closed for holidays. Tomorrow is All Souls Day. My stock of Celexa is over.
POST: To any doctors here - 

Hi. I've been on Citalopram (Celexa) since May. 20 mg. For anxiety. I've been a student in Germany since 2009. Last month when I flew back home to India for a holiday, my doctor there replenished my medication stock for me. But he gave me a 6 month supply of Escitalopram (Lexapro) instead of Citalopram. Escitalopram is just the S enantiomer of citalopram, and apparently has better anti-anxiety effects. 

Today I finished my previous stock of Citalopram. Unfortunately, my doctor here near my flat is on holiday, tomorrow is All Souls Day which is a holiday too. The next appointment I can get is probably next week. Is it okay to switch to Lexapro? I mean, I have no other choice as of now.

TITLE: My dog is having trouble with any new tricks, please help!
POST: So I have a one year old golden retriever who is having trouble learning any new tricks. When I first got him, at 8 weeks, I taught him the basics (sit, down, stay) and manners. Then, I thought touch (with his nose) would be a fun trick to teach, and it was. Until now. Now, whenever I do anything, he tries to touch it and won't learn anything else really.

After I taught him those first 4 tricks, I got lazy and really stopped working on anything besides manners and those 4 tricks. He really doesn't even lay down without a hand signal for some reason. 

How do I work through this? I really would love to work on a lot of tricks, but he really won't stop touching me hand whenever I try to lure him (and I mean like jerk touching, not nice luring).

POST: > Hey, sorry to bother you. Could you unfollow me? I'm guessing you just forgot, but it would help if you did. Thanks. Hope you're good. Bye.

This is the message I want to send him. Around 2 months ago, we cut all ties, following a talk about the previous ~3-6 months of him apparently not giving a shit about me. This has been tough for me, but I've succeeded in mostly keeping him out of my life. I haven't talked to him. I try not to let him get in the way of things in my head (and fail sometimes).

The problem is he still follows me on Twitter. And I've only got like 10 followers, so every time I'm on Twitter, I'm just sort of aware of him there. 90% chance he muted me during the aforementioned 3-6 months and doesn't see anything I post. But it still bothers me.

POST: Hi guys, I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year, and I've always known he wasn't a virgin and kind of tolerated this. However, I recently found out that he had sex with four girls total, two of them were long term relationships, and two were short term relationships. I don't know exactly why, but this hurts me a lot. I feel like he shared an extremely intimate thing with four other people, whereas he's the only person I've ever shared this with (we had sex a few months into the relationship). I guess I feel like it's not fair? I don't know. I know this isn't really rational, but I can't stop myself from being so sad about it.

How do I get over this?

So my mother as been dating an ex drogue addicted (seems clean, dough he smokes some joints every now and then.)

She breaked up with him and he became very stalker-ish and calling all the time and sending sms's all day.

Some months have passed and now my sister says that they are together again, and that he is very possessive and keeps calling all the time to know were she is and with who, and in a very aggressive manner.

My mother wont listen to anyone that says that he is a dangerous person and that she should dump him for good. She keeps saying that he only turn against him-self (threat to kill him self, etc...), and not against other people.

So, what can I say that would make her see the danger? (me and my sister are out of the house for years now, so no problem there)

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

I live in Ontario, Canada by the way.

TITLE: Is there any harm to getting only 6 hours of sleep per night? Can anyone provide encouragement or tips to switch to 6 from 8 hours?
POST: I've decided to try limiting myself to 6 hours of sleep per night. I have a decently long commute and if I try to get 8 hours each night, I limit myself to around 2 hours of leisure time per night, without exercise.

We always hear about famous and successful people who get by on 4 hours (Petraeues), 5 hours (Clinton), or whatever, so I figure there's no biological reason I can't get by on 6.

But when I only get six hours on my current regime, I'm exhausted all day. I'm worried that my work will suffer and I'll be a zombie.

Will the exhaustion last? Will I eventually get used to it?

Sometimes, I feel like some of the things she says can be inconsiderate and hurtful, like I am lacking or not right for her (I would leave you for someone famous, I would sleep with him if he smiled at me like that, etc). 

So I tried to rationally tell her that I was uncomfortable, but her rationale is that its a celebrity and as we are non-famous folk, it would never actually happen, therefore I should not be so sensitive. And then she turns it around and says that I don't have self confidence and that I should work on getting more confidence. 

So, is it irrational of me to feel the way I'm feeling?

My classes are usually pretty big with a lot of empty seats, so I'm afraid that if I just go sit beside a girl and try talking to her, even though their are a ton of other empty seats, she'll think I'm hitting on her and I'll scare her off.

So my question is, how do I talk to girls in class without them thinking I'm hitting on them and getting scared off? Also, because of being a loner my entire life, I'm extremely awkward and have no social skills whatsoever, so the conversations are going to be very awkward for both of us at first.

So, here's my issue: My girlfriend is still friends with her ex (they dated for 8 years) and they are in the same social circle. Whenever there is an outing, her ex is typically present. 

I have no issues whatsoever with my girlfriends ex, but I believe she does with me. She will not greet me or make eye contact. She basically pretends I don't exist and is normal around everyone else. 

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route. 

This is a pretty uncomfortable situation and I'm hopng for some mature tactics to change the situation for the better.

My birthday came a couple days ago, and that evening I checked my email to find he emailed me saying ""Happy Birthday"" (subject line, no text in the body of the email). I responded and said ""Thanks. Sorry I forgot about yours [his had been a month prior]. Hope your birthday was enjoyable and hope you're doing well."" He hasn't responded.

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: First post: 

My boyfriend and I had a very long talk discussing my concerns.  He promised me that there's no resentment building up and emphasized the fact that no one is forcing him to do these things.  I've been trying to compromise more often but he usually insists that we do what I want to do (i.e. picking a movie to watch that he doesn't like but knows I'd be interested in).  In all honesty, his behavior hasn't changed dramatically but he has begun to ask me for more favors, which I'm completely fine with doing.

I'm still not a little anxious about the prospect of us having a big fight but after reading everyone's comments I'm sure that any fight between us won't be as terrible as I've made it out to be.  He's a good guy and he's handled everything perfectly so far.

POST: I planned this vacation six months ago and have been really excited about it ever since. It was a fifteen day solo trip across various cities of Turkey. It started amazing! Today is my third day in Turkey and I loved every bit of it.

However, I want to go back ASAP. I don't know why. Although my return tickets are booked for 6 January, but I have a bad urge to go back tomorrow or day after. 

I thought maybe I'm homesick, maybe I miss people or work. I'm not even bored. There's so much to do and see. Yet, I couldn't put my finger on it. But I'm sure I want to go back. It's just been three days and I'm restless. I can't enjoy the vacation when all the time I'm thinking about going back home.

I'm a mess right now. Please tell me what should I do. Should I go back or should I stay on and finish the vacation as planned?

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?

TITLE: What should I put in a care-package for my unemployed friend?
POST: A friend of mine just lost his job because the office of the ad agency he worked for shut down. He had about two weeks notice which was obviously not enough time to find a new job. He's free-lancing now, but the income is unstable and no where near what  he used to make. SO, my idea was to send him a care package of sorts with random things that he might like that he wouldn't buy for himself with his current budget constraints. For example, I'm going to buy him some film because he likes to take pictures with vintage 35mm cameras, but may not be able to splurge on the film now. What else can I put in? My budget is around $50.00.

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: So my girlfriend and i of about a year were talking about the long term us and how the age gap would play into our relationship down the line. I really love this girl with all my heart and i cant imagine being with anyone else right now. 
She said that my age makes things difficult for her and she wants to eventually settle down. I said that because of my age, i might not be the right one for her. That is where i fucked up.

She immediately started crying and said it was the most hurtful thing I've ever said. She said that it shows just how eaisly i would give her up and to find someone else because i dont care enough to try harder for her.

I deeply regret saying it and she hasnt talked to me since. Im worried that she thinks i dont care about her nearly as much as i should. Im not sure where to take it from here. Replies are much appreciated.

POST: I'm his 18 year old sister (living at home). He is 23 and has many issues and my parents have no idea how to help him. He failed out of college his freshman year and is addicted to oxycodone and uses cocaine and many similar drugs. He can't afford to live anywhere and keeps losing part time jobs, etc. He surrounds himself by the worst possible people to get better. He goes through phases where he tries to get help and my parents will do whatever they can but it keeps costing them a ton of money (therapy that he stopped going to--paying off his car payments, etc). He's been arrested a few times-all drug related and just ended up in the hospital for stomach pains (from drug use). He is currently living at home and any advice on dealing with people who do this would be so helpful. Thank you.

Perfect example: yesterday I took 1 30mg XR at 1:00 PM, waited for it to kick in, and studied until about 1 or 2 AM when I finally felt confident that I was prepared for my exam.  Now, it's 9:25, I still haven't fallen asleep yet, and my exam is in 40 minutes.  Is there some kind of secret as to how to avoid this that doesn't involve not doing it?

POST: I and my best friend are two scrawny white-boys moving out of my parents house for college very soon. In about a month or so, we'll be in an apartment in the less-than fortunate city of Waterbury, CT. We intend to become as friendly with the community surrounding us, just to get on good terms.

After thinking about how to go about all of this, I decided starting a free outdoor movie/media night might just work. But here's my dilemma. I and my friend are going to be freshmen in college, paying rent, and all other expenses ourselves. We'd need a cost-effective projector to suit our needs.

We're thinking about dangling massive white tarp from the back-balcony of our apartment, and using that as a screen. What would be a well-priced projector ($1k MAX) that could get a decent sized image that a large group of people could watch outside?

Okay, so I was in a relationship for 7 years (15-22) with someone. While we dated I put in all the effort, arranged fun dates and tried really hard to be the best gf I could be. He put in no effort and arranged no fun dates. I dated around with a few guys between 22-24, nothing longer than a few dates each. Now I'm with someone who I'm pretty serious about, dating 8 months now.

 In my first relationship I made it a pretty annual thing that we would go on an adventure tour. The only years we skipped were years I asked him to book the tour and he forgot until it was too late and they were sold out for the year. (it only runs June-August). This was something I wanted to do since I was 13 but wasn't old enough until 16.

He absolutely does not want to get his driver's license. I've got mine for over 10 years and i love being independent, and i would like to see him take some responsibility. For example: When we are on a holiday, we sometimes like to rent a car, but i do all the driving. I've tried asking him what would he do if something happened and i had to be rushed to the hospital. His answer; i'd call a cab or an ambulance. Ok, what if i'm stuck somewhere and need to be picked up? He'd call a cab or a friend.

TITLE: (south carolina) multiple garnishments, can't afford to keep going like this
POST: About six months ago I received a writ of garnishment for student loan debt (~$7000) for 15% of my disposable income. Not too bad on its own, but soon after the first writ, I received a second one from a hospital bill I was never served papers for, the garnishment being for a whopping 35% of my disposable income. The student loans are in the process of being rehabilitated and i know there's no way to get around it other than repaying. The medical bills are only for about $3000, but I cannot live on $250 every two weeks. It's definitely worth noting that I didn't contest either writ, because I didn't know how to go about doing so. What are my options here? I cannot afford to hire a lawyer and I wouldn't know how to present this to be honest.

POST: My neighbor probably doesn't know just how thin the walls are in this apartment. I keep hearing her child scream like crazy (usually the kind of scream associated with uncontrollable crying) and then I hear what I think is the mother spanking/hitting her kid. The kid also stays awake much later than it probably should (12 am). I don't know if she speaks fluent english, because I haven't really ever heard her speak it. I did hear the voice of a man once, but he was telling the kid ""STOP IT!"" Should I talk to them and politely ask them to refrain from whatever it is that they're doing?

She had shared some of her photographs with me prior to dating (clothed but seductive natured) and now that we're together she has shared with me more of her photographer's portfolio with nude pictures and some sexual FF photos, but was sure to specify that there is no porn involved.
 I cannot decide how I feel about my serious girlfriend taking off her clothes for others to see (call it In The Name Of Art or whatever, I don't know shit about modeling).

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

TITLE: Why do I [22f] keep dreaming about cheating on my boyfriend [24m]?
POST: For the past month or so, I have been having vivid dreams nearly every single night. These dreams almost *always* involve me at least kissing, and sometimes banging, a dude who isn't my boyfriend. Sometimes it's someone I actually know, other times I've never seen him before. The dream always ends with me waking up in a moment of panic, thinking ""oh my gosh, what have I done?!"" until a few seconds later when it sinks in that it was just a dream and I didn't actually cheat on my perfect, wonderful boyfriend.

I don't understand where this is stemming from. I'm an incredibly faithful woman and I would never dream (well, figuratively I guess) of cheating on my boyfriend. I love him and he completely satisfies me sexually, although I only get to see him once a month or so because we're long distance.

Any idea why this might be going on?

My girlfriend then calls me drunkenly afterwards. Crying, saying that she's sorry she kissed him.

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.
