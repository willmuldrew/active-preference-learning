POST: this guy [20m] and i [21f] had been friends for a couple years in high school, but we stopped talking about 2 years ago, mostly due to the fact that he was in with some bad people, and that i didn't want a relationship with him. we argued a lot, and i got called a lot of names.

a few days ago, he sent me a message along the lines of ""i'm sorry, i've been through a lot of shit, and i realize that you were a good friend and you didn't deserve the way i treated you."" 

should i respond? i would be glad if he's really changed and is trying to repair our friendship, but this could be another way of getting back into contact just to go back into the dilemma of ""he wants a relationship/i don't"". what can i even say to that?

TITLE: My [24,F] boyfriend [26] of almost a year very rarely kisses me... should I be concerned?
POST: Yes, we have talked about it.  He will give me quick pecks no problem, but we have never, ever ""made out"".  Kissing is super intimate for me and I can never get him to do it longer than 3 or 4 seconds before he is trying to get away.  

He claims (and I believe him) that he has a deviated septum and it makes it hard for him to breathe when kissing me, and that he finds kissing to be a bit unnatural and weird anyways.

Does this seem legitimate or like something I should push?  He is very introverted and not very intimate anyways, so it just sucks that I can't even really make out with him.  Maybe I'm being childish... but that's why I'm asking y'all.  Thanks!

TITLE: [Sacramento, California] Renting a house. Water heater is old and insufficient, but not broken. Landlord's or tenant's responsibility to upgrade?
POST: Location: Sacramento, California, US

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

POST: Hi, all. My crop of banana peppers have finally started to come in, and I am going to have a CONSIDERABLE amount the whole summer long (I bought 40 plants for $6 and they all lived; some hot, some sweet).

My main question I would like to ask pertains to battered n' fried banana peppers. My mother attempted them a few years back and they failed. Miserably. The batter didn't stick and when it did it was so thin it couldn't be tasted or felt. Now, I did not assist her in her endeavor, so I don't know exactly what she did to find where she went wrong. So, dear chefs, how do you all go about making fried banana peppers? It should be noted that I own a deep fryer.

Side question: what should I do with the rest of my peppers? I need ideas because I'm not about to let all these peppers go to waste. Trust me: I'll have enough to do whatever I need to do to them.

POST: My girlfriend is having a lot of emotional issues lately. She calls me nearly every night deeply upset, it usually takes me an hour or two to calm her down. She wants to seek medical help, meaning a therapist, or a counselor of some sort. Her parents have agreed sort of, but have taken no action. I am worried because it has gotten to the point to where she is severely depressed and thinks about hurting herself and throwing up sometimes because she doesnt feel good enough, she just as of a few months ago got over a eating disorder. I want to get her the help she needs but i obviously cant pay for it by myself. I dont know what i can do.

POST: I went for an annual physical with a new doctor who is my PCP. She asked me if anything was bothering me and I told her I had a slight plain in my foot. The Doctor said to try stretching it and make another appointment if it keeps hurting. She wrote it down in my file and told me that was only to put down as much information as possible to justify the other blood tests she was running to the insurance company. 

Weeks later her office is charging me for two office visits for that one time because I mentioned having foot pain. Insurance paid for most of it but I have to pay the remainder. 

The doctor never told me at the time of the visit that mentioning pain would change the nature of the visit. Does this count as fraud? What should I do?

POST: I broke up with my girlfriend after just over a year of seeing her last night. A couple of months ago I moved to uni over 2 and a half hours away and the long distance has effectively ruined our relationship. Neither of us were happy so I decided that it would be best to end it.

She is my first true love and we've experienced everything for the first time with each other, so letting go of that was very hard. She wants to see me as 'just friends' which would mean her coming up to stay with me for 2 days next week.

The exercise I was mostly doing was on an exercise bike in front of my pc. I set up a playstation controller so I could cycle and play games and watch youtube videos and netflix. It works quite well and I usually spend 1- 1 1/2 hours on the bike.

And now on to the question. My bike says in my last cycle I burned 350 calories in 90 mins ( I know I cycle slowly. It's kinda in the background as I play or watch videos. It's usually about 10 - 13 mph). I just started on a website called sparkpeople and they list exercises and when I added the exercise as 90 minutes it said it should be 900 calories for exercise bike <12mph. 
Does anyone know why there is such a big difference?

TITLE: Me [17M] concerned about age gap with a potential girlfriend
POST: I am an exchange student in a foreign country this year, and in the next few days i will be going out with a girl that i met recently.
My concern is the age difference and wonder what you guys think about it. I am 17 and will be turning 18 in 2 months, she is 16 and her birthday isnt until november. 

So i am 1.5 years older than her and it makes me a bit unsure, even though when i met her i assumed she was 17/18 based on her looks.

I recently read a post about some girl (15) that was going out with a guy that was like 24. I know that is totally different but just reading the stuff about how the family was very concerned etc puts me off. Because there *would* be a period of a few months where i am 18 and she is 16, and i worry about the connotations of that and what her family etc would think.

TITLE: Reddit, how would you costume a 19th century Fisherman, à la Captain Nemo?
POST: I'm putting together a pretty good costume idea for Halloween this year that involves a not-so-period-perfect 1850's fisherman.  I've done some research and I've decided to stray away from the actual period clothing.  Its difficult to find leather shoes and britches- petticoat or otherwise.  

Here's what I'm planning on:

- Wool coat, preferably a pea coat
- Thigh waders
- Turtleneck
- Stocking cap
- slacks, thick cotton
- worn wooden tobacco pipe

Take in to account I don't have any of these items on hand and I'm working with a reasonable budget.  From that list, do you think its possible to convey a ""swarthy fisherman persona""?  Is there something you would do differently?

Its rare that I would put this much advanced planning in to costume but I've had the idea all year.

Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

TITLE: I just put-in my 2 weeks notice. Why does this feel like an uncomfortable break-up?
POST: As the title says, I just put-in my 2 weeks notice at work. My bosses seemed shocked and saddened. 
The strange thing is that they tend to be rather ruthless and fire people with little to no warning, for reasons that are questionably truthful.
However, instead of jumping for joy, I feel saddened and a little depressed. I even thought about taking back my notice of resignation because of how saddened they seemed.
The closest feeling I can think of that's similar is when I break-up with some who is obviously not a good fit for me. Which is usually followed by doubts about whether or not I should get back with my ex.
Is this a normal thing when ending a 'professional relationship?'

POST: So i bought a nice used car for 11.5k+ tax (2009 Accord coupe v6) And they gave me a high interest rate (7.19) for being a young male. I put 3k down so  I'm close to 9k left. my monthly for 48 months is $269 with Ally. I tried paying $100 extra a month but those con artists are not applying the whole amount to the principal! My first extra payment only 60 bucks went into the extra principal. the next like 80 went in. the rest is being applied to the finance charge.... I've called multiple times to tell them the WHOLE payment needs to be applied. they tell me because finance charge is calculated daily it gets taken out of my monthly payment. the rep told me to add my extra $100 to the monthly statement thats due near the end of the month. Is that good advice?

I was given a Bobbafett (is that how you spell it?) helmet during Christmas. After derping around with my friends enough, I decided to make something cool with it: A Daft Punk style helmet, with LED lights and all that jazz.

I don't know if it's possible to do that using the Bobbafett helmet. And my friends didn't seem to be interested in the idea, thus I want to ask Reddit for inputs.

Do you guys know where I can start from? Oh, also - I have hardly any experiences with electronics as well as craftsmanship skills. Thanks, reddit.

TITLE: How can I become a consistent planner and a hard-worker?
POST: I am a huge procrastinator and a half-ass-er (is that a word?).  I procrastinate on just about anything that requires the most minuscule amount of work, and always try to find the easy way out of everything (as in, if a task requires a lot of effort, I'll either half-ass-it, take an easier, more crappier route to doing it, or just give up).  

This has obviously negatively affected my life in a bunch of ways, and frankly, I'm tired of it.  Reading or watching motivating things has temporary effects, and failing to achieve something I aimed for will cause me to panic and actually try hard for a while until I rationalize the failure in my head and find comfort in landing on an inferior plane.

POST: I'm navigating being primarily a contract worker, and my current contract is up on June 30, meaning I get to crawl back to Covered California for my health insurance for now. I'm expecting to actually use it (therapy and prescriptions and such), meaning I can't just do a Bronze or High Deductible, and I don't expect to be unemployed very long. I have an HSA account, and I've read that I can use HSA funds to pay my premium for Bronze or Silver level, but it's unclear if that works for Gold (no deductible).

POST: In the past three months I've reduced my total debt from about $20,000 to $9,200.  While it's possible I can do the same for the $9,200 with commissions I am not and have not budgeted for possibilities.

I've budgeted out the next year based on my minimum income with no commission.  This plan sees me debt free by August 2016.  All of my expenses are covered, and any commission I receive  moves my debt-free date forward.

The budget factors in savings, my HSA, and my simple IRA to get my employers max contribution.

My question is, now what?  All I do is eat, sleep, work, gym, and repeat.  I've deactivated Facebook, I don't party, I quit drinking, and I got rid of my car since I live in a metroplex and walk or uber pretty much everywhere I need to go.  This actually costs less than having a car in my situation.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

POST: So me and a group of 7 friends were going to go see Wicked (a Broadway play) tonight. I was all set to go until I got a call from one of the friends in question. He told me that one of the girls in the group had some shit with me and wouldn't go if I was going to be there. Not wanting to cause any trouble I decided that I wouldn't go.

But what I want to know, is why she had shit with me. Me and her have never been the closest friends and I don't believe I've said anything that could have upset her. In fact, I haven't really hung out with her in a long while. Any ideas of why she might not want to see me, Reddit? Any advice on how to get closer to her?

I am a programmer from the DC area.  My wife is going to start grad school next Fall, so we will be packing up and moving to LA at the end of this summer (August/September... about 6 months from now).

**Problem:**

I'm afraid that my inability to start the job until the end of this coming Summer will disqualify me from most jobs currently available.  I know a lot of companies hire college grads way in advance, but I don't know if companies will hire people this far in advance if they are already in the industry.

**Question:**

Do I apply for jobs now or wait (if so, how long)?  On one hand, I want to start applying now so I can have a job secured before I get out there.  On the other hand, I don't want to disqualify myself by applying to positions too soon.

I really need advice on this...

 I do not understand what happened, we were perfectly happy a few days before. 

She just sent me a text out of the blue only wanting to be friends even if we had made plans to do things during the summer.

 I sent her a ""sorry you feel that way, but thank you for the memories"" kind of message, but she didnt answer.

 I feel so lonely and want her back but most people around me tell me to forget her

Should I just let go? Even after all we have done together?

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off? For example, I know most males aren't supposed to eat fewer than 1500 calories a day, and when I do (or did, should I say) the weight loss just isn't as prominent (not to mention that at below this point, the body's chemicals start to unbalance).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

POST: I have known her for about 3 years. Became friends with her a year and a half ago. Being introverted and shy around girls it's hard for me to talk to her face to face but we've talked even if it isn't as much as I'd like, we've also gotten to know each other pretty well through messaging.(almost every day)

I have come to like her, but I have no way of telling if she likes me or not. She has made it clear that she thinks I'm amiable, and also noticed me not having as much face to face interaction, but I've made it clear that I'm shy and embarrassed.

I am well aware of the limitations for the age difference at the moment. I'm just so confused at the moment because some times it feels as if she is attracted to me, but that can be my imagination.

TITLE: Guys, what are your thoughts on virgins?
POST: I'm almost 20 years old and still a virgin (mainly because I haven't had the opportunity to bang anyone I actually *like*) and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. I'm not saving myself or anything, but I don't want to sleep with the first guy that's probably hitting on me either. You know?

Anyhow, I've seen plenty of questions asking the reverse, but I am really curious about the male perspective. Mainly because so many guys I've spoken to have said things like ""Yeah, she was a virgin so I had to take one for the team there"" and ""I don't understand the whole 72 virgins thing... who wants a virgin anyway?"" etc. To be completely honest, it makes me a little bit self-conscious. (They probably don't know I haven't had sex; I usually know what I'm talking about and am pretty comfortable with the topic, even if I don't know first-hand)

I am working out more and actively making new friends and things like that but this is not about moving on. 
My real question is how do i meet more people, and of course meet more gals. I do not drink (ever) so bars are not much help (nor are they really my scene) and all i really have is my work at a barnes and noble and home. Trying ok cupid which but not much going on there, i am average looking i guess (if you want to know what i look like, look at my post history)

We still see each other and behave like a couple when we're together, but she insists we'll never be a couple again.  I think we can get past the differences, but she is adamant it's over forever.

Also, I have seen quite a few ""ZOMG THIS JUST HAPPENED TO ME!"" but I have seen the attached photos or have heard that story (almost exactly the same) sometime before.

POST: So I went to the lady doc today and got confirmed that I do have HPV with GW. It's a small case of it and I'm getting them removed at my next appointment. Lady doc was very optimistic that I shouldn't have problems after that.

BF is aware that I've been exposed to HPV but not the GW part. We have not had sex yet (and it's super frustrating) but I told him I don't want to put him at risk and he understood. He's been very patient (as patient as someone can be in a new relationship anyways).

Here's the issue. I know I'm going to tell him that I have HPV. My question is, how do I tell him that I have a small case of GW caused by that strain of HPV and may not be able to get it removed until August (or even POSSIBLY September)? 

I'm GOING to tell him. I'm just looking for the best possible way so that I don't mess this up.

Thanks for all the comments and thoughts.

I told her on Monday that we needed to break up. She was surprised at first and understandably upset. I told her that we were just becoming two different people and that it would be better to end the relationship on a high note before we start to resent each other. 

She still wants to be friends, which I understand. I don't know if it will work out, but I told her that after a while of no contact we can reach out and see if we're ready to establish some kind of platonic relationship.

So I'm sad and newly-single. I've been going out drinking with a good buddy from work, and that has made me feel better. 

I still can't help thinking about her, but I hope that she'll be happy. I hope we both will be. :)

POST: I have had a number of close female friends where I have been unsure of their interests or intentions. I'm not looking for anything more than friends, but sometimes I get hints that they might be interested, or..I am reading too much into things.
For example, there is friend I have been hanging out with pretty often recently I haven't been sure of. She has a boyfriend she seems to like pretty well and often tells me about, but she also does things like push her breasts up on my arm while we were looking at a map together yesterday, and she always gives me a hug when saying goodbye. 
I think I've indicated I just want to be friends, but maybe I need to clarify?

I'm starting my senior year in college, and have got a decent chunk of savings from working during breaks/thanks to my (nearly) free tuition.  Right now, I've got almost $30,000 saved up.  I've accepted a job offer for next year for $100,000/yr, so I will be making a good deal of money and have no debt.  

My parents have said that I could stay at home after I graduate for saving up for house/apartment/whatever if I need to.  So, for that first year, I'll have nearly no expenses.  I will be working/living in Boston, MA, USA.

My issue is, I have zero knowledge of anything financial.  I don't know what is a good safe place for money, what do do for real estate (buy/rent), how having this money will affect me in terms of tax/what I can do for this?

POST: We met on tinder and texted constantly for about 2 weeks before we decided to meet. We hung out at his apartment and ate food and just chilled. We did not kiss or sleep together.

Then the next night he invited me over again and we both got pretty fucked up and we ended up having sex. This was on a saturday. 

The following monday he invites me over again to cuddle and thats exactly what we did. No sex, no anything we just slept.

I initiated plans for the next time we hung out and it was really fun and went well.

I was at his place last night and I cant help but feel like hes not into me anymore. When I asked if he wanted to hang out he said ""if you want to"". And hes just barely texted me since I left. I'm not sure what happened because I thought things were going well.

It's starting to get rather serious but before we started talking she warned me that her parents (father especially) would disapprove of her dating outside her ethnicity. She also said that she'd probably have to keep it (the relationship) a secret from her parents. It didn't really phase me at the time because of how early the stage of the ""relationship"" between the two of us was, how ever now it is really bugging me.

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

Upon lifting his pants-leg (which was totally fucking gay) and looking at it, closer inspection revealed that it was a mass of bone.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

I understand they want to know more about who they might potentially hire and it's a fair question, but I think this is the main reason I haven't got a job yet after 3 interviews: I find it extremely difficult to sell myself.

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes.

Why wouldn't he want to bring his girlfriend along to meet everyone?  He told me how he was talking about me, and what I did to everyone, so I guess if he's proud of me, why did he leave me behind?

Also, I think he meant for it to be a ""guy's"" night and I think I'm just being ridiculous... but I can't help but feel a little hurt.  Can someone knock some sense into me?

We've been together since last May, but took a 2 month break last summer (due to long distance) so we've been together for 9-11 months. Anyway, he seems to have recently lost his sex drive. We haven't had sex in about a month and I don't know what to do. Even when I try making out with him he either doesn't seem into it or participates for a bit and then just wants to sit there with me holding him. I have a very high sex drive, and I'm getting increasingly frustrated that my only release is masturbation (which is happening sometimes twice a day at this point, because it provides some release but doesn't really leave me fulfilled). We've talked about this a bit but it seems like nothing's changed since then. What should I do?

We talked a lot, and agreed we have some real issues.  Primarily, she has trust issues with me.

POST: Hi guys,

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

What should I do now?

We know we are breaking up and accept the fact. We both know that I will be with other girls and she will be with other guys during the duration she will be gone.

We will be breaking up reluctantly and mutually.

I feel this is worse than a messy break up. If its messy, you can fight, hate each other and forget about it. In this case we are both reluctant, will be keeping in contact and will both be lingering on for the 4 months knowing that both of us are with other people.

I spent some time researching, and I found the address and number of my biological mother, but not my biological father. I called her phone, and she answered, but I didn't say anything. She lives in the mid-west, and I'm in New York, so I'll probably not get to visit her. I want to find out who she is. I don't have any motivation for it except that we share DNA, so I guess I want to know who she is and what she's like.

After I taught him those first 4 tricks, I got lazy and really stopped working on anything besides manners and those 4 tricks. He really doesn't even lay down without a hand signal for some reason. 

How do I work through this? I really would love to work on a lot of tricks, but he really won't stop touching me hand whenever I try to lure him (and I mean like jerk touching, not nice luring).

She really wants to meet me and spend time with me (She implied doing other things but that is not super important to me). She is somewhat attractive to me and she is nice enough.

Here is the problem I am having. She said she is going to breakup with her boyfriend so we can date (I had never even implied I wanted to date her). She said she loved me and cried when I didn't say it back and she has multiple times gotten very upset when I did not respond to her text and she even went as far as adding me on Facebook.

Should I actually meet up with her? It could be a good time but there are a lot of things that concern me about her. If I should not, how should I separate myself from her?

And he said yes you go do that and so I took her to the side, bought her a few drinks started kissing making out all that stuff, I ended up following her around for the whole night. She got to me smoke, I don't smoke, I was all over her. I feel like I probably harassed her the whole night and made her feel uncomfortable.

He shaved it all off today for a job, and he looks like he's 16. He's just simply not very attractive without it. I hate how it looks. And it's not like he can just grow it back, because this job doesn't allow facial hair so he can't grow it back until he gets a new job and that might be a very long time.

POST: We met 2 years ago on the first day of work. 

I unfortunately fell for him and he decided to lead me on. Now my normal core reaction to never talk to that person again. Well this time it was different. I did everything possible to forgive. We managed to form some semblance of a friendship. Granted I have to do all the calling, asking, waiting and planning for us to hangout. 

Now you would think that if he was going to go off and get a girlfriend he would tell me. We hangout  every other week so you would think he would mention this. Nope! Didn't mention it once. 

Now when we go out everyone thinks we are together. Walking close, whispering in my ear, the accidental bumps into me. Constantly looking at me big pouting eyes. 

Am I being ridiculous for being upset he didn't mention this?

I only do cardio. Always scared of the weights, don't know how to do them, don't/can't get a gym membership. I now will try weights, and this is where you come in.

I have a dumbbell set, and some open space, and that's basically it. Can anyone suggest some exercises/routines of what I should be doing with my very very limited supply of weights? Again no room for a bench press and shit like that. 

What I'm looking for is links to videos on YouTube etc...where I can throw them up on my computer and do the exercise while they are doing the exercise in my room....that way I can't ""learn"" and do things properly in the comfort of my own house.

TITLE: How often should I hang out with my gf and her kid/
POST: I'm 28, she's 25, and he's 5. We've been an item for 6 months.

Someone mentioned that I am spending a lot of time with the kid too soon. I understand he has no dad and I don't mind helping. I just think I still want to get to know the gf, since we barely have our alone dates.

I think we hang out 2-3 times with the kid and only one time at night with the gf which is usually Fri or Sat. Those nights aren't by ourselves either, they are with a group of our friends.

I don't want to tell her that I don't want to hang out with her kid, which I like but sometimes the dates are a little dull when he comes along. I do not want to hurt her feelings.

Also I need to mention, that its hard for her to get a sitter so he comes along.

TITLE: How to ask for more time to decide on a job offer?
POST: Sorry about asking this again. I read like 20 threads and 20 articles about this issue, but a lot of them were either not really answered, a different situation, or some combination of the two. I know this question in the most repetitive questions thread.

To start off, the usual. Job A gave me an offer, I'd like to wait for Job B to offer. Job B still requires another interview at least.

The problem for me now is that Job B is much better than Job A. Job A is part time sales associate, Job B is full time in a different field I'd probably consider continuing. That makes Job B the ""dream job"", and I would definitely take it if offered.

Will a part time job even give me time to think about it? How do I ask them for that time without them just moving on with a different candidate. I also dont want to waste their time and mine by reneging.

I think it may have a lot to do with the way dress/present myself. So my question is, what types of things should I wear? How the heck to I make myself appear older?

And when I try to dress a little more sexy (when I go out, not to work obviously) I feel like I just look like a 17 year old tramp.

POST: Hey there! First of all, without getting into too much detail, let me say that the age difference is not a problem. He was the one who started the flirtation between the two of us.

Right now, I'm not interested in actually hanging out. Not just yet. I want to indulge in the ""texting game"" for a little while first. My question for you lovely men and women is what kind of texts would you like to get from someone you're interested in to start up a good conversation? My demeanor and sense of humour is very playful, sexy and just a touch cocky. I'm just starting to run out of ideas! 

Thanks for the help. :)

POST: So I have a fear of commitment when I enter into relationships. This is the main reason none of them have worked out. Last night I was laying in bed thinking and I think I know where it stems from.

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?

POST: Hi, so I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I visited a doctor a while back and she prescribed Sertraline for general anxiety and agoraphobia.  While I started the medication I experienced dry mouth,  which I was willing to sit with.   One day,  though,  I was getting out of the shower and became extremely confused, which really scared me so I stopped the medication. 

That was all before I started school.  Since this semester began I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety.   For a while I was handling that, until my grades started to fall.  After that I became unmotivated, lethargic,  and irritable.  

Now I'm debating going back on the meds because I've not been able to ""kick"" the depression.   My concern is that I might experience more of the side effects.  If I've already experience a few, does that mean I'll experience the others?

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

So I was wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, being mean sure doesn't sound like a good way of changing this.

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

POST: My boyfriend and I decided we want to get married a few weeks ago, and we are going to do it NEXT MONTH!! We live in Hawaii with NO family and just about 10 friends we made here on island. We figured people spend thousands for this kind of destination wedding so it makes sense for us to have a small one here and when we move back mainland in a few years have another bigger ceremony for friends and family. 

Does anyone have recommendations for sites to help organize this chaos?  Would it be rude to not have a reception and just ask the island friends to join us at Dave & Busters for drinks and games?

My brother is getting married on Friday back in my home state so we will be telling all my family AFTER their reception. (Not about to steal someone else's special day.)

All help appreciated fellow brides!! :)

POST: So we broke up a few weeks ago and now she is dating someone else in my friend group. I don't know what to do.

However, cutting them out isn't such a simple task. Like I said my friend group is very close and I'm afraid it will tear a hole in our friend group if I delete them from my life. If everyone is hanging out and they're there, I don't think I could muster up the strength to go. I'm lost and afraid. Life is never fair is it?

Time will hopefully heal this, but right now I'm devastated and a mess.

Also, while you were there, you had to do some task, like never open your eyes. All of the keepers had names like ""Keeper of Light"" or ""Keeper of Blood"" or something. Any info would help.

POST: I did a stupid thing and dated within my friends circle. I know, I know. Lesson Learned. But now I have a new problem.

This group of friends go out for breakfast every Saturday Morning. It's become a tradition that we've come to look forward to. We go to the same delicious restaurant with fair prices, and the wait staff knows us all by name.

My ex and I continued to attend after the breakup. We looked past the awkwardness because the tradition had become so important (and fun!). But now a new obstacle has presented itself. He has acquired a new girlfriend who has no taste for my presence. Thus, he set an ultimatum for our friends circle: It's either him or me.

What do I do? Do I continue to go with my nose high, saying that he can stay home (since this is just childish)? Or do I put my pride to work, and step back so as to avoid any of this ridiculousness? Which option would make me more mature?

He absolutely does not want to get his driver's license. I've got mine for over 10 years and i love being independent, and i would like to see him take some responsibility. For example: When we are on a holiday, we sometimes like to rent a car, but i do all the driving. I've tried asking him what would he do if something happened and i had to be rushed to the hospital. His answer; i'd call a cab or an ambulance. Ok, what if i'm stuck somewhere and need to be picked up? He'd call a cab or a friend.

Reddit tell me to stop being a nagging girlfriend or help me tell him to man up..

He's recently developed this great idea that after graduating, he wants to hitchhike across the country and perform circus type tricks to make ends meet (unicycle, hacky sack, juggling, etc). He doesn't want a 9-5 job where he's tied down and just wants to go live life freely. He cited The Spartan Student as a reference as to how he can make it work ([link] To make things worse, he doesn't have plans as to what he wants to do with his masters degree in computer science. He just wants to get it because it's only another year after his bachelors.

Does anyone have any sort of experience with this type of mentality? What are the dangers of living like that? Do others think this is as dumb as I think it is?

However I have no idea what i'm doing and thus i'm not sure if this is actually a relationship. Or how to make it an official one without being insanely awkward.

Why can't I tell? 

To summarize last year she got asked to prom with some guy she barley knew so we ended up hanging out at after prom then hanging out and wandering the town until 3AM. During this time I had opened up about my depression(I had burns on my arms) which stemmed largely in part about me being confused about my sexuality.

So now i'm wondering if all this hanging out just makes me her ""gay friend"" or if we are unofficially dating, And what I should do in either situation?

POST: Throwaway account. Here's the details. They're quite juicy. 

I was in a nightclub the other night and a random girl came up to me and started making out with me (wait a second, I'm not as lucky as you think). I was such in shock I didn't do anything. It lasted for about 5-8 seconds and stopped when she told me she needed a smoke outside and left me. Today (48 hours later), I've felt the worst pain urinating I've ever had in my entire life. All we did was make out, is it possible that I can have urinary pain from HSV-1 or is that urinary pain just from something else?

POST: Been on two dates with this woman I met recently, first meeting was just getting to know each other, and we was holding hands and made out at the end of the second date.

However I am starting to get irritated that it seems to be me doing most of the chasing even though she definitely seems interested. We last spoke a few days ago and we said we would arrange meeting up again this week, we have both been busy and not spoken since that message but I have had enough of always making the first move... so should I wait it out with the prospect that we may never talk again?

Not really sure how to handle the situation, she is a lovely woman and enjoy spending time with her... but I am not prepared to always do the chasing?

TITLE: Me [24 M] with my fiance [25F] 6 years, living in my mom's downstairs apartment?
POST: Hi Everyone!

Me and Fiance are getting married in October and we are currently looking for places to rent. My mom has an apartment opening up downstairs (no shared entry way) which would be about 350/ month cheaper than other places in the area. My fiance and her friends tend to think this is unhealthy. My mom is pretty cool and not hovering at all, so I dont think it would be much of a problem but i wanted some opinions. Do you think it is worth it to save the money or should we really try to avoid it?

Thanks!

If any redditors in the L.A. area need a PA, please please consider me. I'm a college grad with lots of multi-media knowhow (AVID, FinalCut, CS4) and I need steady work badly. I had a temp job with Google that lasted 2 years, and I assumed (wrongly) that it would look good enough on a resume to land me another job. I'm running on empty, I moved back home and it's clearly becoming a financial strain on my parents. I'll work infinite hours, and work hard. I'll start at the bottom and work my way through smiling. I have no ego, I have no attitude. I just want to work, earn enough to move back out, and get my life going.

POST: Hi all, looking for some advice. I'm running a 12K on Saturday morning.  This is not a terribly long distance for me, as I've done a number of half-marathons and when I run during the week, it's generally in the 5-6 mile range.  My last training run was Tuesday and I ran 8 miles.  I usually hit an awesome sports conditioning class on Thursdays.  My legs are sometimes sore for a day or two afterwards, since squats and lunges are often involved.  I'm looking for a decent time on this 12K, and the first 3 miles is uphill, so I'm wondering if I should just skip the class.  What do you think?

Honestly the best thing I liked about her was that she was innocent and cute now I just don't see her in that way anymore, I'm still loving towards her because I thought I just needed time but now I know it's just not happening. Today I told her that I think we should hold off having the wedding and I think she knows what the problem is.

I know it's not her fault because she didn't even know me then but I now know I can't marry her because she just isn't the same person in my eyes anymore, Has anyone been through what I have.

Why are they doing this? Why are they tearing apart at the portion of the audience that knows and loves the books, when they followed them so closely in the previous season?

Does anyone else feel this way?

 My boyfriend and I have a fantastic relationship. We live together, are very open and communicative in our relationship and have a lot of fun together.

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

I don't want to start something and then find out later that it won't work because I can't see her that way, and hurt her in the process. Am I being shallow? Advice?

My girlfriend of three years told me that she doesn't associate with either gender and wants me to stop addressing her as anything female related. One of the main things that bother me is that she wants me to stop referring to her as a'she' and now start calling her a 'they', so I'd have to say: ""they want me to start calling them my partner instead of girlfriend."". 

I can't get my mind to it, how do I go about this? I'd really like some insight from different people because my partner is giving me a hard time when I have trouble adapting.

I told my friend that I was going to go under 23 minutes this race and I did it. About 200 meters before the finish line someone who obviously seemed to want to pass me ran up to me and passed me slowly. I thought to myself that I would let it happen considering how tired I was.

POST: I have been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now and things are great.  It's the best relationship I have ever had.  He's caring, loving, ambitious, and we share the same values and life goals.

However, the age difference is always in the back of my mind, making me wonder if I'm doing something wrong by dating him.  He's still in college and I've graduated a little while ago... And I know people say that dating younger mean's you're not mature enough to date someone your own age.

Does that apply to this 3-year age difference?  If so, how do I know if that's why I chose him?  

I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance that this age gap is normal and healthy.  He says he never thinks about it, but I also think that's because if people are going to judge us for the age gap they'll put the blame on me.

POST: So not long ago I (26M with 24F) [sought advice on a relationship changing from a good friendship to a relationship](

So when we got together after the Christmas break, things were sort of stilted and awkward. I figured something was up, so I didn't make any sort of advances and when she left after last weekend, things got even more distant. By weeks end, I asked her to talk about it and she admitted that she perhaps wasn't as ready for a relationship as she had professed.

That's fine, it is what it is... but now I'm having a bit of a rollercoaster trying to figure out how to rebottle the genie after having a conduit for the feelings I had for her. That said, she's one of the best friends I've had or could ever hope to have and to her, the friendship is ironclad... so if anyone has any thoughts on how I can quash the neuroses and get back into that stride, I'd appreciate it.

POST: Hello,

 I've recently been hired at a small company as their ""Marketing guy"" meaning I will be updating their website, implementing their social media marketing, and creating brochures. 

*Now fast forward to the interview*

The boss notices my history and experience working in the field of IT. He informs me that they also need someone at the company to support the few desktops and servers that they have.

The starting pay for the Marketing position is $15/hr. Now that I passed my probationary period and they offered me the fulltime position, is it reasonable to ask to renegotiate my salary since they added Desktop and Server Support to my daily job duties? And if so, how can I come about doing that respectfully?

Meanwhile, Ive started to see this other girl, and were exclusive (Met her around the same time but recently started putting more effort into it). We enjoy each others company and do a lot of similar activities and my friends really like her. 

Im confused as to what to do... Ive been trying to live in the moment and focus on what is right here and now but its hard to not drift back to her and think of what it would be like when [20F] comes back.

TITLE: Charles Schwab vs Vangaurd Target Retirement
POST: Long story short - I recently started investing into a Roth IRA account. To be specific a Target Retirement Fund that will mature over time as I grow closer to retirement age. Due to a recommendation from a coworker, I opened up the account through Charles Schwab and have already transferred an invested $3,000 into the Target Fund. 

However, I've since learned that Vanguard has an identical account as the one I chose through Schwab, and the fee's are less and the YTD returns are more. Here are the number differences:

*Charles Schwab 2055 (SWORX) Net Expense Ration 0.73% / YTD Earnings 2.97%
 

*Vanguard 2055 (VFFVX) Fees & Expenses 0.18% / YTD Earnings 6.95%  

My question is - how easy is it to switch from one fund to the other, and is it even worth the hassle?

Upset and feeling like it was time to move on anyway, I wanted to give my notice and quit. My mother suggested though that the best way to ""stick it to them"" is to take a leave of absence then go on disability for a couple months (I have a legitimate disability that is exasperated by my job).

TITLE: Fried Banana Peppers
POST: Hi, all. My crop of banana peppers have finally started to come in, and I am going to have a CONSIDERABLE amount the whole summer long (I bought 40 plants for $6 and they all lived; some hot, some sweet).

My main question I would like to ask pertains to battered n' fried banana peppers. My mother attempted them a few years back and they failed. Miserably. The batter didn't stick and when it did it was so thin it couldn't be tasted or felt. Now, I did not assist her in her endeavor, so I don't know exactly what she did to find where she went wrong. So, dear chefs, how do you all go about making fried banana peppers? It should be noted that I own a deep fryer.

Side question: what should I do with the rest of my peppers? I need ideas because I'm not about to let all these peppers go to waste. Trust me: I'll have enough to do whatever I need to do to them.

TITLE: Does my friend have LEG CANCER?!
POST: My friend and I were about to go get some food at 11 PM when he was resting his legs on my own. I was resting my hand on his leg and felt a weird bump below his kneecap. Upon lifting his pants-leg (which was totally fucking gay) and looking at it, closer inspection revealed that it was a mass of bone.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

So.... Anyone want to tell him that mass of bone isn't normal / tell us what it is? I'm aware of the Kneecap and the smaller kneecap-like bone behind it that helps facilitate movement, but this is below his kneecap, IE his leg doesn't run smoothly down, it has a jagged ridge of bone below his kneecap for a few inches before evening out.

I went to school for a year and a half at one place, then went to cc for a semester, and then came here. I swore up and down that this is what I wanted to do, so my parents agreed and boom, here I am 12 hours from home. I'm doing pretty well in my classes, but I just hate being so far from my family because we are so close. I feel pretty badly about spending so much money on out of state tuition as well, even though my family can afford it. It's a great school and I like it here, but life just isn't the same with my family so far away.

TITLE: Me [18] with my crush [16F] Should I delete her from Facebook?
POST: So I've had a crush on an exchange student in my school for the past 6 months. We never really talked that much but we had short conversations sometimes. Saying hi and such. I had a feeling she liked me becouse she kept liking my facebook pictures and statuses and when I saw her looking at me she quickly looked down. I just had this feeling. But for the past weeks she did not speak at all to me or look at me. So I said fuck it. If she doesnt show interest I wont either. So we began ignoring each other I guess. Suddenly yesterday she liked my picture again and today I found out she is going back to her country. She said goodbye to everyone in class except me while in the corridor... I'm so confused if she liked me or not... so I'm asking. Should I delete her facebook since I won't ever see her again anyways? Or should I type to her or something? I don't know...

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

Escitalopram is just the S enantiomer of citalopram, and apparently has better anti-anxiety effects. 

Today I finished my previous stock of Citalopram. Unfortunately, my doctor here near my flat is on holiday, tomorrow is All Souls Day which is a holiday too. The next appointment I can get is probably next week. Is it okay to switch to Lexapro? I mean, I have no other choice as of now.

It's only a dollar raise and it's double the responsibility. The money matters to me but what matters most is the experience.

Managing over 15 people for 8 hours, giving feedback, developing the associates, presenting meetings with other managers. However I still have to do the work that normal associates do. For my case this is a car dealership so I have to manage my team while still cleaning cars and getting look down on by other departments. So my question is, is it worth it?

So I am 22 years old, and just got my first job out of university (yay!) 

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

POST: My boyfriend has recently started using Instagram again and there was a girl who very regularly used to like a lot of his selfies until we were in a relationship (We've been together for almost two years) and didn't like any of his pictures again until the other day when he posted a picture of himself doing a sport he likes. 

He was scrolling through his Instagram feed and I happened to look over as he went past a picture he had liked, it was the one of this girl wearing a very revealing top. He carried on scrolling past very quickly and I asked who it was, not in an accusatory way, just in a normal tone of voice and he very quickly said it was a girl he knew from school and immediately changed the subject. I'm sure it's nothing but if it was, why would he try so hard to hide it from me?

TITLE: Can someone take back something they gave to you as a gift?
POST: My uncle was staying with my grandfather for about a year.  He was slowly throwing away my grandfather's old things (television sets, bath towels, etc) and replacing them with new things he bought and gave to my grandfather as gifts.

He suddenly gathered up *everything* he ever purchased in my grandfather's house (even if it was a Christmas gift from 30+ years ago) and left with it.  My grandfather is in a tight spot now because he's missing a lot of items he's come to depend on.

One of my friends said that if something is given under the agreement of a gift and then it is taken back, that can be considered property theft.  I know so little about all this, but I can't help but feel it's wrong (at least on a moral level).  Is there any legal backing, or is my grandfather just out of luck for accepting gifts?

Background: Went out and had some drinks came back home, missed a step outside and fell ~5 steps landing on my knee (concrete). When I awoke the next day I did the best I could with what I had (beach house) to clean the injury.

That was 4 days ago, my scrape is healing pretty quickly, already about 30% smaller from the original wound, BUT since Day 1 I've been having this white-yellow discharge from the scrape. It produces at an accelerated rate when I shower, I try to place a paper towel over it and press lightly to lift some of it off. From what I gathered, it's not smelly, which means it's not infected. It is a little red around the outside, but I figured I'd check in with you guys to double check.

TITLE: Should I invite FMIL?
POST: As the title states, I need opinions on whether or not I should invite my FMIL.... 

FH and I picked our venue a while ago. We did our tasting, and we brought my sister (also my MOH), and FMIL. 

Since my mom and two best friends have not seen the venue (and BFF's will be helping to make decorations), I planned a night with the venue that I can bring my mom, two BFF's and sister to check out the venue. 

Should I also invite FMIL? She lives about 5 minutes away from the venue, and her and my mom haven't met yet. I wanted to have them meet on Mother's Day this year by taking them out for brunch with FH, but he kind of dropped the ball on getting her schedule to me in time to book anything. 

I feel this wouldn't be the best circumstances for them to meet under, I would like for it to be nicer, but I also feel like it's important for them to meet!

I called the company, and he was really vague about who called him to boot my car. He said he thinks it was management, but a local office manages the property and they're across town. I've also parked in visitor parking hundreds of times, and even overnight. 

The thing is, I can't get a hold of management. No answer to my emails or phone calls. Any suggestions on what I can do?

TITLE: What are the pros/cons/potential pitfalls of adopting a data-only VoIP smartphone plan?
POST: The long story short is that I want to upgrade my phone but in the long run it will cost me hundreds (perhaps thousands) of dollars to do so because I would have to give up the unlimited data plan I have right now. The desire to save money has fueled my research to find a different solution, and recently I stumbled on this article: 

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

TITLE: My boyfriend [21 M] has cancer, and I [20 F] am not sure what to do. Please help.
POST: The issue here involves more than just cancer. My boyfriend, Eli, has stage II lymphoma, along with other health problems. He was supposed to die at the age of 16, but he's still alive. I met him at work and we got close pretty fast. 

I would never leave someone over the fact that they have cancer. However, he does not talk to me very often. Sometimes, we go days without texting. Sometimes, we go weeks without seeing each other. He says he's always busy with friends or family, and it makes me feel like he doesn't want to see me. 

It makes me really sad to know that he has such a limited time, but he doesn't seem to want to spend it with me. That might be selfish, and I hate myself for being upset by this. 

I will always be there to support him, but I guess what I'm asking is if we'd make better friends?

TITLE: Me [24 M] not sure if I should pursue a [24F]
POST: So I'm 24 and I'm talking to a woman who seems cool, we get on and share a lot in common. 
However she talks about how she gets bored in relationships easily and having her head turned also quite easily. 
Not cheating per se but lusts after other people I'm assuming. 
So she seems cool, but these traits aren't exactly attractive and I feel like it's going to just lead to a world of pain if I try to go forward with this woman. 

I have two questions, one is to people who do/did get bored of relationships easily, how did you overcome that if you even managed to?

The other question is to people who have dealt with someone with these issues before. How did you deal with them, did you manage to overcome them and have a succesful relationship? or should I not even bother? 

Thanks.

Ever since I was a little kid I have been playing with legos, building stupid things, and most recently built a computer. (I know none of these things qualify me as an engineer.)

 I do not understand what happened, we were perfectly happy a few days before. 

She just sent me a text out of the blue only wanting to be friends even if we had made plans to do things during the summer.

 I sent her a ""sorry you feel that way, but thank you for the memories"" kind of message, but she didnt answer.

 I feel so lonely and want her back but most people around me tell me to forget her

Should I just let go? Even after all we have done together?

Long time redditor. Throwaway account. I do tech support via e-mail, from one of our call centers. It's not the best job in the world, but I love the company I work for.

I have a chance to change that. I have the opportunity to put together some suggestions to improve it, and have someone with actual say; evaluate it and possibly run with it.

My question to you Reddit is; what do you think would make decent hold music and voice overs? Alternatively, what upsets you the most with them? (my pet peeve is Christmas music).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

TITLE: Should I just buy or wait?
POST: So I have some money that I was saving for around five years. A week ago, I went to watch some game videos on youtube which led to a 3DS video which had me thinking that I would want to get one. The problem is I have just about enough money to get a regular one but I'm not really into the black color that the regular ones have and I prefer the white ones available only to limited edition ones. (I know there is a white regular one but it's an Asian version, right? I would like to opt for a US version so I can benefit from Club Nintendo) 

Three days ago, I saw someone selling a Pikachu 3DS XL on the internet but it costs twice as much as a regular one. I am currently looking for a job to get money to afford it.

I caught her once before, and she told me she would never do it again. A couple nights ago she went to her friends house with her friends (all if whom smoke weed), and told me she wasn't going to. 

I'm not really proud of it, but she was asleep and I looked through her phone and low and behold, she was talking about getting stoned. How do I confront her about this without hinting towards me doing what I did to find out?

POST: I'm 23, horrible at flirting, never had a gf, blah blah blah.  NO idea how to flirt.  I've asked several of my friends and they all pretty much say that I should be suggestive.  So I sent a girl (probably 20-ish), who's number I got a week ago, this:

""So you don't have work today and I don't have work today.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking? :)"" 

Because women love smiley faces right?...Right?

She responds with ""I'm at work pal.  I close, but it's nice to hear your off.  I hope your enjoying your day off.  I'm going back to work from lunch.""

Asked a female friend and she says that the girl was obviously NOT happy with my text and that I was being TOO suggestive...upon review I got the same feeling.  So after lurking for a couple years I decided to make an account to get a consensus on how to flirt.

TITLE: My [24,F] boyfriend [26] of almost a year very rarely kisses me... should I be concerned?
POST: Yes, we have talked about it.  He will give me quick pecks no problem, but we have never, ever ""made out"".  Kissing is super intimate for me and I can never get him to do it longer than 3 or 4 seconds before he is trying to get away.  

He claims (and I believe him) that he has a deviated septum and it makes it hard for him to breathe when kissing me, and that he finds kissing to be a bit unnatural and weird anyways.

Does this seem legitimate or like something I should push?  He is very introverted and not very intimate anyways, so it just sucks that I can't even really make out with him.  Maybe I'm being childish... but that's why I'm asking y'all.  Thanks!

TITLE: Lake Michigan Credit Union/Rewards checking accounts
POST: I'm currently with Ally bank and their.84% interest rate is nice, but I just found out about reward checking accounts with LMCU offering 3% interest if certain demands are met: direct deposit, 10 debit card transactions, 4 logins to home banking, and electronic billing statements. These are all things that I do anyway, except for 4 home logins a month which is quite doable. Have any of you tried this/ does it sound enticing?

As it is a credit union it is insured by the NCUA, does this all sound too good to be true? Is there a catch I'm missing?

TITLE: [infidelity] me [26] them [25] military and fraud
POST: Me [26] recently found out someone in the military cheated on their wife with another married service member in 2014. His wife left him shortly after. Their divorce was finalized last week may 2016. I've learned he had still received the dependent pay and the basic housing allowance for having a dependent and he did not report their physical separation to his command. I feel he has committed a lot of wrongs and some illegal wrongs. That's fraud. There is proof in their divorce decree when they legally separated 7/20/2014. Can I report this fraud? Whom do I contact to report it to? 

I find it distasteful a service member behaved in this manner but committing money fraud? And he's even said to me he could get into trouble for still receiving these benefits. What should I do?

POST: We are on amicable terms but I have not shared much of my life experience with them for a long time. This is because I did many things in life that they have disapproved of, and after many uncomfortable talks during which harsh words were exchanged and I was chased out of the house (but subsequently returned), I decided not to share any of those experiences with them again. They mainly have to do with my boyfriends and staying over, the usual stuff I know, but my parents are EXTREMELY conservative. Now that I am completely independent financially and my parents seem more vulnerable and in need of my support, I really want to get closer to them again but it's hard.

We broke up in June. It wasn't easy for me. I didn't feel like I got enough closure and she just dropped off the face of the earth. 

Well I've been dating this new girl called T for a month or so and shes great, tall, blonde, sweet, gorgeous, looks like Blake Lively sp?. I know that in most situations this would be great, my ex saw me with a gorgeous girl and I looked happy.

But I dont feel good about it, I dont feel like I won something. I feel bad because I still care a lot about her (the ex) and I wish we were still friends. Should I just continue the no contact, or should I reach out and see if she wants coffee sometime? I already broke the no contact, I sent her a small email that just said ""You look good"". No reply.

POST: Got into an argument with my friend but I started to realize that I had no evidence or stats to back my claims.  I genuinely support the idea that OWS protesters stand by.

POST: I did a stupid thing and dated within my friends circle. I know, I know. Lesson Learned. But now I have a new problem.

This group of friends go out for breakfast every Saturday Morning. It's become a tradition that we've come to look forward to. We go to the same delicious restaurant with fair prices, and the wait staff knows us all by name.

My ex and I continued to attend after the breakup. We looked past the awkwardness because the tradition had become so important (and fun!). But now a new obstacle has presented itself. He has acquired a new girlfriend who has no taste for my presence. Thus, he set an ultimatum for our friends circle: It's either him or me.

What do I do? Do I continue to go with my nose high, saying that he can stay home (since this is just childish)? Or do I put my pride to work, and step back so as to avoid any of this ridiculousness? Which option would make me more mature?

In less than a month, I'm turning eighteen.

I've always been that person that never celebrated his own birthday. This is because I didn't really have any friends until I got out of middle school and because I always thought my parents were embarassing.

I do have some friends now, and I've been invited to several 18th birthday parties myself. However, I still do not  really want to celebrate my birthday. The house I'm living in is a mess and I wouldn't even know what to do or prepare for such a party. 

The real problem is that people ask me what I'm gonna do for my birthday etc. Whenever I tell someone that I haven't planned anything, they look overly surprised and I don't know what else to say. What am I supposed to do? Is the 18th birthday really a ""must-celebrate"" and will people be mad at me if I won't do it?

I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?

TITLE: Can someone please help me find a PA job in Los Angeles?
POST: This is a complete shot in the dark, but I'm bordering on desperate so here goes:

If any redditors in the L.A. area need a PA, please please consider me. I'm a college grad with lots of multi-media knowhow (AVID, FinalCut, CS4) and I need steady work badly. I had a temp job with Google that lasted 2 years, and I assumed (wrongly) that it would look good enough on a resume to land me another job. I'm running on empty, I moved back home and it's clearly becoming a financial strain on my parents. I'll work infinite hours, and work hard. I'll start at the bottom and work my way through smiling. I have no ego, I have no attitude. I just want to work, earn enough to move back out, and get my life going. 

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this.

TITLE: Soccer / Futball Keepers of Reddit, How Do You Protect Your Hands Besides Gloves?
POST: I play on an indoor soccer league that runs 5v5 with a keeper each. We play on turf and boards (think hockey rink) and because of the turf and how close the shooter is, I get absolutely rocked while playing keeper. 

I wear decent ($100 ish) keeper gloves that have the plastic spines behind the fingers to help protect you from having your fingers overextend but even with those my pinky and ring fingers really hurt. Sometimes I take a particularly hard shot and I mess up my wrist.

Normally I would tape up my two fingers together but since I am wearing gloves it prevents that and I really don't want to tape them on the outside. Any suggestions is welcomed.

I know I'm not in a relationship with my ex anymore, but it felt as though I was cheating. I might (don't yell at me for this) be holding on to a tiny bit of hope that me and my ex will get back together eventually.

Is it too soon to be dating? Should I stop seeing this new guy even though he's amazing? I'm most definitely not over my ex yet. Do I have to tell him about this new guy? I really don't want to hurt anybody.

POST: Hello again /r/askreddit.

Story:

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

So I was wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, being mean sure doesn't sound like a good way of changing this.

I love him so very much, but I am scared that I'm not good enough for him. I know he loves me too, but my insecurity is hurting us and I have no idea how to change.

It's starting to get rather serious but before we started talking she warned me that her parents (father especially) would disapprove of her dating outside her ethnicity. She also said that she'd probably have to keep it (the relationship) a secret from her parents.

I think the only thing preventing me from asking her out is the situation with her parents. I'm worried that if I do start dating her, I wouldn't want it to be a secret from her parents.

TITLE: Can I take HMRC to court for being late processing my return?
POST: It seems completely unreasonable to me that if I pay my VAT bill 12 hours late, I am fined almost 100% of the figure for doing so, yet I have just got my tax bill from 2009/10 (it was 40p!), nearly a year late and somehow it's OK for HMRC to just write a limp apology letter.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

POST: Hi guys,

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

What should I do now?

POST: So As of late I've had a large stroke of bad luck and today my windows decided to go nuts. Upon starting up my laptop this morning I got a few errors, looking them  up and trying to fix them I got rid of them. 10 minutes later I got a windows update so I restarted my laptop, windows 7 bootscreen comes up then a blue screen of death decides to show up. Thinking the BSOD was a fluke I restarted again and I got the loginscreen, logged in, desktop was starting up as slow as hell and then again a BSOD...

So after a hard long search for my Windows 7 disk, I find out that it was thrown away a long while ago with the key... As I am against pirating, I'm probably going to buy windows 7 again but I remembered that the consumer version of Windows 8 is already here...

I took another girl on a date when we were arguing, but she knows nothing physical happened..  but she said that still eats her inside even though it was 4 months ago.  

I've been trying to convince her that I want to be a better father and boyfriend to her since she decided to leave two weeks ago.

POST: Sorry for venting, but I was tricked into going to a seminar the other night. The guy I met said to meet me at a Subway and after I arrived he told me to get back in my car and follow him to a hotel lobby across the street... yes, I knew something sketchy was up. I didn't know it was about Amway until I wasted 1.5 hours of my time. I have a business background and could have picked apart their business model but wasn't given an opportunity because after the presentation the guy didn't have any Q&A opportunity. The thing that worries me most is that there were 30+ people there that actually believe this stuff and invest so much time and money into this flawed model that I almost feel obligated to do something about it!

TITLE: What's the biggest lie you've ever told?
POST: It occurred to me just now that when I was smaller I used to lie a lot.
I told some serious whoppers in my time.

The week before my ex and I split, I spent some time at a hotel room with this guy I knew, anyway we hung out and..you know. Had sex.
Suffice to say my neck was covered in huge Hickeys that were EXTREMELY visible, and had turned into a dark red discolouration by the morning. 

So when I got home and saw my partner I looked her straight in the eye and said 'oh god, I got bit by a spider last night when I was walking to the shops!'. I felt so incredibly guilty and horrible for it. But she somehow believed me.

We broke up shortly afterwards because I couldn't stand the fact I was cheating on her, and because we were all kinds of wrong for each other. But that is another story.

So reddit. What's the biggest lie you've ever told.

POST: I am (attempting) to run the Charlottesville Half Marathon ( my first race) on April 7th. Always played team sports (lax) but now post college have been working on running.  My longest run thus far has been 8 miles, last weekend. I added 2 miles last week because I have been behind schedule and was planning to do the same today (run 10 miles).

 The week prior to the 8 mile run  I had to skip a week of training due to illness. Today I am supposed to do another long distance run but I am feeling achy and fatigued. 

Do I do the run and take it easy? Should I rest? Am I totally fucked for running this race with all these training interruptions? Would appreciate reddit's expert advice!

He was scrolling through his Instagram feed and I happened to look over as he went past a picture he had liked, it was the one of this girl wearing a very revealing top. He carried on scrolling past very quickly and I asked who it was, not in an accusatory way, just in a normal tone of voice and he very quickly said it was a girl he knew from school and immediately changed the subject.

So, here's my issue: My girlfriend is still friends with her ex (they dated for 8 years) and they are in the same social circle. Whenever there is an outing, her ex is typically present. 

I have no issues whatsoever with my girlfriends ex, but I believe she does with me. She will not greet me or make eye contact. She basically pretends I don't exist and is normal around everyone else. 

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route. 

This is a pretty uncomfortable situation and I'm hopng for some mature tactics to change the situation for the better. 

Thank you in advance!

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

In France, we have about 20% charges on the ""brut"" salary, which then gives us the real remuneration. For example, if your remuneration is **30k€/year**, that will make you **24k€/year real remuneration** (or 2k/month).

However, I've recently obtained a job interview for what could be a dream job in the gaming industry in **Ireland**.

So obviously one of the first questions I had to myself was : 

Well, how can I know what will the life cost in another country? That way I would know better what to ask as a salary during my job interview.

Other than that, there is a lot of information to be found (like the cost of a flat, the taxes, etc) and I have only 2 days to get everything.

I told her that I can't see her in order to help myself forget and move on, so I asked her not to write me or call me. Today is/was my birthday, and she wrote me, and told me the she's sorry to break my wish, but it's my birthday so she had to write. It pains me, I have to admit that she wrote me, I feel very down once again. The question I want to ask is, whether I should her write back anything at all or no?

TITLE: Me (29 F) with ex (29 M), wondering if I should try and start things again?
POST: My ex an I broke up in December for the following reasons:
-Possibly incompatible future plans
-Different personal habits (he's very meticulous, I'm pretty slap dash and we get annoyed at each other)
-He messages other women and numerous points in our relationship, even after we agreed to be monogamous (this is the big one, of course)
-He's from a different culture and making his family accept me would be difficult.
-Different communication styles (more open vs contained)
-When together, we both felt hesitation/had difficulty committing to a future together.

The following is why I want to get back together:
-I miss him
-He's said he could stop messaging others/commit if we get back together
-I don't know if I'll ever find anyone that I'm that connected to

Is this relationship worth retrying on? Help. I have mixed feelings.

Anyway, we're in a not-quite-long-distance relationship--he lives an hour away and drives to see me once a week. I know that generally when breaking up with someone you're supposed to do it face-to-face, but I feel like it would be unfair to make him drive all the way to see me only to be broken up with and have to drive back. Would a phone call be acceptable?

Also, if he asks why specifically I'm breaking up with him, how in depth should I go? I mean, there aren't any smoking guns or anything, I just... I don't miss him when he's not around, and I don't get excited to see him apart from the sex.

We will stay up until 4:00 in the morning talking with our arms around each other lying 3 inches from each other's faces. We tell each other absolutely everything. (except this of course). I'm not sure if she actually cares about me or she is being a huge cocktease because she does not want to lose her problem solving talking friend. This is the most awkward situation ever.

Recently I was traveling across the country with my girlfriend and we stopped to talk to many of her friends and mine along the way. We meet up with one of her friends that is always obsessing over guys, and then complaining about how she cannot find Mr. Perfect.

She goes on to talk about how she met a guy that slept with her and then she stole his underwear. She went on to say that every time she is in the bathroom it is like their smells come together as one. We were sitting at a restaurant and as soon as the waiter leaves us she lifts up her dress to show that in fact she is wearing the underwear right that second. I about died.

POST: After reading ""The Giver"" in 6th grade, it's always stuck with me. Once or twice a year I'll give this book a read. The ending has always struck me as powerful, because you're left with a kid who's run off and at this point has no one, dying in the snow. In his dying moments he hears music in front of him, and maybe behind him, as a sign of his ultimate sacrifice in order to bring color to the world. I've always seen it as a strong, poetic ending and I think it's shaped much of my philosophy in life. For reference sake I'm now 27.

Spoiler alert. Then I had to go and read books two and three and find out that the kid from The Giver's not dead at all. He went and became leader of another dystopian future-town (that I guess has been inundated with the horrors of capitalism through the Trade Mart?)
