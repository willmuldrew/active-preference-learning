To start off, the usual. Job A gave me an offer, I'd like to wait for Job B to offer. Job B still requires another interview at least.

The problem for me now is that Job B is much better than Job A. Job A is part time sales associate, Job B is full time in a different field I'd probably consider continuing. That makes Job B the ""dream job"", and I would definitely take it if offered.

I work 30 hours a week, for which I'm paid at around the going rate.

I have a job on the side, which I'm allowed to do when I take holiday from my work.

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I'd appreciate tips on strategy about how to achieve this… and am sure that the kind and wise folk on self.jobs can help me in my goal!

POST: So my gf just recently got her Ipod touch stolen from her bag at school. She wasn't happy about it obviously, but she took it maturely and she went on the itunes thing with the locational services thing. She changed the passcode lock  and she found out the location of the person when they used the wifi, and noticed they changed the name of the ipod. My question is, can this information be used as evidence, that the person who lives there possibly stole it? I mean i'm pretty sure you can't just track random ipods...... that would be a bit creepy haha

We met through swing dancing, as I was one of the few girls who was really good at his favorite style. He started FB messaging me in a flirtatious manner about two weeks ago and I flirted right back. We sent silly messages for a week straight, and on Monday had a little silly touch-flirting and chatted in depth between dances.

Now, my messages are getting quick, ""Hahaha that's funny. Later!"" notes. He's still being goofy on the dance floor and I'm getting lots of deep dips (:D) but I'm not sure if he's just a dancefloor flirt. 

I understand that he might be busy, but I was intending to Make A Move^TM and don't want to lose my good swing partner to awkwardness if he's backing off. 

Advice?

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

POST: So, back in August a friend of mine asked me out on the terms that at some point we were going to break up. Mainly because neither of us were looking for a serious relationship and wanted something temporary to at the least have a little company now and then. Lately I have been feeling like the charm of this relationship is wearing off and I would like to part ways as ""lovers"". However, I am unsure as how to broach the subject with out it coming off as shitty.
------
  The complicated part is that my ex whom I dated for 5 years brought up the subject of working things out. ( He and I remained very close friends though out the 2 year since our breakup. And yes, the current knows about him and our history...) While I am hesitant to make any plans with my ex, I don't want this to come off as I am specifically leaving my current for my ex.

So my boyfriend of roughly 6 months is getting braces in a couple of days, like I said, and I'm scared I'll find him less attractive. He doesn't have very crooked teeth as is and I really like his smile. He's already kind of dorky looking, in a way that I find extremely attractive ofc, so I think they'll enhance his dorkiness. I'm not gonna break up with him or anything if I think he looks weird. Just wondering if anyone else has felt that way? I know I'll probably just have to get used to him having them, he's probably going to have them for over a year. In addition, i know this can be an uncomfortable experience, what can I do to help him deal with the pain for the first few days? Is there anything I can buy him and stuff to make him feel better?

POST: Me and my girlfriend have been dating for over two months, and I have noticed that she hangs out mostly with guys. She has a few close female friends but she recently changed majors and haven't been hanging out with them much. A week ago she told me she was gonna hang out with this guy, just the two of them. It worried me a little but I just shrugged it off. Now I have noticed that she hangs out mostly with guys, sometimes just the two of them, and some of them just shrug off the fact that she has a boyfriend. From how she acts around my friends, I can see that she is really a friendly sociable person. She has assured me many times of her loyalty, and I have been accepting it. But it bugs me that any time something could happen which is why I am posting this now.

TITLE: PSA: Buying a kid's bike isn't just about the wheel size.
POST: I thought the wheel size was the only measurement that mattered.

Learned the hard way that's not the case.

No one ever talks about ""crank arm length"" -- the length of the arms that the pedals are connected to. And the length is pretty damn important. They are generally measured in millimeters, and the 170mm crank arms that came on my kid's 20"" bike are as long as those on my adult bike. (Apparently this is a thing on BMX bikes, this bike wasn't clearly billed as such)

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

Trying to find replacements, but these aren't parts generally designed to be replaced on cheap bikes. So now it's one of those situations where attempting to save money is probably going to cost more money.
TL;DR:"," 

Don't buy a kid's bike if you want to ride it safely. You can't just swap out the crank arms for longer ones.<|endoftext|>",Don't buy your kid a bike they can't sit on first. Bite the bullet and go to a store or bike shop.,RANDOM,10910,snowy-plant-214,128,6,False

One day,  though,  I was getting out of the shower and became extremely confused, which really scared me so I stopped the medication. 

That was all before I started school.  Since this semester began I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety.   For a while I was handling that, until my grades started to fall.  After that I became unmotivated, lethargic,  and irritable.  

Now I'm debating going back on the meds because I've not been able to ""kick"" the depression.   My concern is that I might experience more of the side effects.  If I've already experience a few, does that mean I'll experience the others?

POST: So using at throwaway, and I'll try to make this quick. 

Some backstory: I have been dating my girlfriend for around 7 months, in that time I have been focusing mostly on my schoolwork and didn't have a job. She did, and her schedule would sometimes run into our plans, oh well, it happens. We adapt.

I just got a job and have to work 5 days a week, from 7:30- 11. I didn't choose this schedule, its the only time that fits with my classes.

Because of my new schedule (combined with my school/work and hers), we can only talk one hour each night after work.

It's only been a few days and she is getting angry at me, even though she told me ""we would get through it and be fine"" after I asked her.

How do I proceed?

Other than that, there is a lot of information to be found (like the cost of a flat, the taxes, etc) and I have only 2 days to get everything.

POST: Pardon my French, but today fucking sucked. I won't go into details but basically at the end of the day, I am left feeling dejected and unwanted. So I decided to head to bed early and as a complete routine action, I took my clothes off to get into my pajamas. I did so in front of the mirror, and all of a sudden I realized that I wasn't that upset anymore. Starring back at me was this girl with a HOT BOD - a feeling of joy and pride hit me. It reminded me that this was something good in my life, the fact that I am healthy and fit. 

Looking in the mirror never really had any bad effects on me, but it certainly never made me feel HAPPY. It is usually a routine part of my day that I fly through as if it didn't matter. Taking 5 minutes to look at my body in the mirror and admire my hard work over the last 6 months gave me an instant reason to live.

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?

I work 30 hours a week, for which I'm paid at around the going rate.

I have a job on the side, which I'm allowed to do when I take holiday from my work.

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

POST: I've been dating this girl for about 5 months. We meet almost every day, call/message all the time - we really like each other. I'll be going abroad in a years time to do a 17 month course - I'll be back home twice or thrice a year. 

She says she doesn't want to be in a long distance relationship. So, I guess, if I leave we're going to break up - even though I don't want to.

My question is - What's the probability that her opinion will change if we go out for another year? Should I just break it off now and find someone who wants to be with me no matter what the situation before we both get more hurt?

I don't know what to do honestly, I love her but this pressure and the fighting from this subject is pushing me away.

We broke up in October after I left for college and he stayed home. 

Since then there hasn't really been a clean break (still have flirted and hooked up when i'm home) but he has told me several times, ""I've changed, I want to be single and do my own thing. I still care about you and there's still a special bond, just not romantic"" 

It hurts every time. But I don't really want a relationship either. I just don't want to let go of the past, so I'm afraid of really breaking things off (no contact style) and not seeing him over the summer (even though he would still live in a different town, just closer)

I just don't know if it's worth the stress or if it's what I really want. It kinda makes me sick to realize how much I think about it.

TITLE: Reddit, What is the most awkward think that you and your partner have experienced during sex?
POST: I kind of don't want to get into mine but it is a throwaway account so...here goes.

Well, one hot summer night my wife and I(lets call her tykwesha) were having some fun in bed and I was eating her out with her sitting on my face. I enjoyed it for the first 5 seconds or so until she let out the nastiest shart I have ever heard/smelled. I was horrible I even felt drips all over my face and till this day that night will never fail to haunt me.She is no longer my wife because of the resulting mental issues I had to deal with. I couldn't even be in the same room as her after that night because of the sheer disgust I felt the second it happened returned so.. we eventually got divorced. And a few years of therapy later I am now dating again and am proud that I can now talk about this.

TITLE: How long will it take me to go from running ~15mpw now to a 3:45 marathon sometime in the near future?
POST: I run casually right now but I really want to run a marathon at 3:45 someday. I ran chicago two years ago at 5:15 and I know this seems like a huge difference but that previous marathon was done on very little training (I wasn't as dedicated to training as I should've been). Now I want to make this happen and am feeling much more motivated to stick to a solid plan. 

I don't want to get hurt so I don't plan on trying to make this happen this year but how long do you guys think I need to base build before I can train for a race time like this? And what type of training plan worked for people that finished at this time?

TITLE: Me [23/F] with my best friend [23/F], need some advice on how to gently talk her out of a new hobby?
POST: I'm a fairly successful comic in my city's local scene. My best friend has been to a few shows recently, and decided that she's interested in performing at some upcoming open mic events.

She's been writing material and asking me to look at it for her and tell her if it's funny. To be blunt, it isn't. She doesn't seem to be particularly suited to writing comedy.

I've been trying to help her workshop, which she asked me to do, but I'm starting to think that there's not anything I can really do to help her make the material stronger. It's just not that good to begin with, and anything I can think to do to improve it just makes it sound like MY comedy, not something of her own.

What's the best way to tell her that I don't think she's cut out for this? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't want her to end up embarrassed.

POST: I can't really go into too much detail as he asked me to keep all the details on the down low and I would feel guilty going against it, but he's basically been in an on/off relationship with this girl for the last eight-ish months. She was extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative, and he still wants to believe that she is a nice person. He doesn't want to let go. She ended up dumping him for someone else. He's extremely devastated and has basically let his life go and I hate seeing him like this. It's incredibly upsetting to hear about all this stuff she's done to him. I've been in a similar situation before, but I don't know how to handle it. How can I help him? I am listening, but I also don't really know how to respond to a lot of the stuff he's saying (but I want him to know I am still there after he types the long blocks of text.)
