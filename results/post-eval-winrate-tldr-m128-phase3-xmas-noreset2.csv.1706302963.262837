POST: So I have a one year old golden retriever who is having trouble learning any new tricks. When I first got him, at 8 weeks, I taught him the basics (sit, down, stay) and manners.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I don't know if I'm being irrational or not. You can't stop loving someone in the course of a few hours, right? I've asked if anything was wrong and he said there wasn't, and then he left to go take a nap since he didn't sleep well the night before (which I said I love him twice before he left, which he didn't acknowledge.) I don't know what's going on and I'm really anxious about it. What should I do?

TITLE: Me [17F] wanting to get over feelings for best friend [17M].
POST: My friend and I met when we were 13. We didn't begin to be good friends until junior year started (last August). We hang out on the weekends, text everyday, and share a few classes with each other. Initially, I didn't harbor feelings for him and would give him dating advice. He is very self-conscious around girls he likes, which leads me to believe he doesn't see me in that way since he is so open with me. I guess in all the time we've spent together and the chemistry we have as friends has led to me growing feelings for him. Whenever we sit in my car in the mornings before school listening to music, I have been having this urge to just kiss him.

This could potentially be threatening to our friendship and I wish I could stop myself from liking him. Any advice? What do I do? The last thing I want to do is lose him as a friend.

POST: I have been told so many different things by people who are NOT car salesman and i was hoping reddit could clear things up for me.

Last month I leased a new 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe.  

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?

Also, the sound system is crap, and i would prefer the upgraded model with the better system.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company.

TITLE: Can I take HMRC to court for being late processing my return?
POST: It seems completely unreasonable to me that if I pay my VAT bill 12 hours late, I am fined almost 100% of the figure for doing so, yet I have just got my tax bill from 2009/10 (it was 40p!), nearly a year late and somehow it's OK for HMRC to just write a limp apology letter.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

What is/are, according to you, the most important thing(s) to take into account? I'm not sure how to build a career and spend my money in a way I won't regret it.

I'm ambitious and I want to shine in what I do and I want to work hard for it. In return I would like to earn good money for what I do and gain respect from other people in the sector.

Maybe those points are a little bit unrealistic for in my twenties but hey, I don't know any better, I never worked before. (Other then silly summer jobs)

Right now I have 2 credit cards I haven't been able to pay in forever, tickets and such that I can't afford and have turned into warrants, a car that is on its last legs and nothing but trouble, and I owe 2 friends money. I just got a second job that should at least give me the ability to start paying somethings off. 

Should I consider consolidating my debt? I figure I should pay the tickets off first so I don't go to jail. I really just need tips on how to start this process so it doesn't feel so hopeless. It has me really depressed right now which only leads to problem avoidance and denial. I need to change this situation starting now!

POST: My boyfriend and I decided we want to get married a few weeks ago, and we are going to do it NEXT MONTH!! We live in Hawaii with NO family and just about 10 friends we made here on island. We figured people spend thousands for this kind of destination wedding so it makes sense for us to have a small one here and when we move back mainland in a few years have another bigger ceremony for friends and family. 

Does anyone have recommendations for sites to help organize this chaos?  Would it be rude to not have a reception and just ask the island friends to join us at Dave & Busters for drinks and games?

My brother is getting married on Friday back in my home state so we will be telling all my family AFTER their reception. (Not about to steal someone else's special day.)

Recently, they've been getting rid of their eBanking checking accounts and converting them to Core checking accounts (many fees if you don't maintain a balance of ~$2,500).

The text is a little fishy, so i open up the thread and see that she has told him that she dreams about them hooking up. This has really been bothering me, but I am not sure if I am overreacting. I understand that you can't control your dreams, but admitting it to an ex who wants you back?? I am hesitant to talk to her about it because of the whole 'I went through your texts' conversation, and also I am not sure if this is as big of a deal as I am making it out to be in my head.

So, am i blowing this out of proportion? Should I talk to her about it? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

POST: Hi guys,

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

POST: Hey everyone... First post on reddit, so please forgive me if I make any mistakes. Anyway, basically what I'm looking for is any words of wisdom, or to hear from someone in a similar position. Or tips on how to deal with any of it, any insight is appreciated.

I went to school for a year and a half at one place, then went to cc for a semester, and then came here. I swore up and down that this is what I wanted to do, so my parents agreed and boom, here I am 12 hours from home. I'm doing pretty well in my classes, but I just hate being so far from my family because we are so close. I feel pretty badly about spending so much money on out of state tuition as well, even though my family can afford it. It's a great school and I like it here, but life just isn't the same with my family so far away.

TITLE: How can I get my live-in landlord to change his rules without causing tension?
POST: So, this person is exceptionally difficult. There are a bunch of annoying rules he's imposed post-me moving in, he's probably the stingiest person I've ever met, and he's decided that it's acceptable for the heat to be at 5ºC when no one's home, 10ºC when sleeping, and 15ºC when someone's home and awake (41, 50, and 59ºF, respectively) thus resulting in me being fucking freezing always. I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June. The most annoying part about it is that he goes about telling me the rules with a ""that's the way things are"" attitude, and like, I understand it's his house, but I'm paying rent, damnit. And a third of utilities.

POST: My friend and I were about to go get some food at 11 PM when he was resting his legs on my own. I was resting my hand on his leg and felt a weird bump below his kneecap. Upon lifting his pants-leg (which was totally fucking gay) and looking at it, closer inspection revealed that it was a mass of bone.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

So.... Anyone want to tell him that mass of bone isn't normal / tell us what it is? I'm aware of the Kneecap and the smaller kneecap-like bone behind it that helps facilitate movement, but this is below his kneecap, IE his leg doesn't run smoothly down, it has a jagged ridge of bone below his kneecap for a few inches before evening out.

Any ideas what it is?

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract).

But a friend was saying she might be nervous about talking to me because she may like me, or just cuz I'm a boy. She is the shy type, after all. Personally I'm banking on the latter. :/

So, this reaches out to teen (or once teen) girls. What are the REAL signs that you are interested in a boy? Or is this just all about the girl herself? I always hear things about her looking at you and looking away when the guy sees them. Ya know, typical things.

TITLE: Are Men allowed to freak out?
POST: Just as a bit of backstory:

I've been under an incredible amount of stress lately and I had a meltdown.  I ended up punching a dumpster and couldn't hold back my emotions.  I didn't hurt her in any physical way, but she's angry at me.

The basis for her anger is that I ""don't have good coping skills.""

on average, i'd say I have 1 or 2 big ""meltdowns"" a year and the rest of the time I am totally normal and she's told me repeatedly that I am ""the most patient person she knows.""

Am I allowed to freak out?  I know ""allowed"" isn't really the right word.  I don't channel any anger towards her when I'm under a lot of stress.  at least I don't think I do.

A few weeks ago, me and the fam were putting up lights on the house for the holidays.

First thing that went through my mind as it happened was, ""Oh shit, I'm fucked.""

TITLE: I [24M] have been seeing her [25F] for a few weeks. Is it acceptable to go on a date with another girl?
POST: I've been going out with a girl (let's call her Girl A) for a few weeks now - I see her about once a week. We've been physically intimate with each other, but haven't really discussed whether the relationship is serious, exclusive, etc.

At this point, would it be wrong to go on a first date with another girl? My  concern  is that Girl A assumes that we're exclusive and that asking her would lead to questions about whether I've been seeing other people, at which point I'd be obliged to tell her about going out with Girl B. I don't want to be dishonest, but I also don't want to take myself off the market until I'm confident that the relationship is going somewhere. After all, I have no idea how Girl A currently feels about the relationship or whether she's been going out with anyone else. 

Thoughts?
