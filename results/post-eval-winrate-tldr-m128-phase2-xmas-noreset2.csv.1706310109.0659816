TITLE: DAE grow up in a house where both parents were alcoholics? How did you cope? How are you doing now?
POST: When I was a kid (about 6), my parents would leave me and my older sister (9-10) home alone and go to the bar, only to return around 12-2am (sometimes 4am) drunk. I was afraid I wouldn't see them again some of the nights. I have no idea how I coped, but I guess I just eventually accepted the circumstances. My self-esteem was relatively low while growing up, and I can't say I'm very emotionally stable. I don't do drugs or drink regularly, but I used to go through jobs like candy until I learned to get my self stabilized. I feel I've come pretty far (got a steady job, at least), but I still occasionally have very self-destructive habits. I'm not sure how much of this (if any) is caused by my parents drinking habits. But I thought I'd see how other people that grew up in this situation are doing.

POST: I broke up with my girlfriend after just over a year of seeing her last night. A couple of months ago I moved to uni over 2 and a half hours away and the long distance has effectively ruined our relationship. Neither of us were happy so I decided that it would be best to end it.

POST: Hello /r/advice

In less than a month, I'm turning eighteen.

I've always been that person that never celebrated his own birthday. This is because I didn't really have any friends until I got out of middle school and because I always thought my parents were embarassing.

I do have some friends now, and I've been invited to several 18th birthday parties myself. However, I still do not  really want to celebrate my birthday. The house I'm living in is a mess and I wouldn't even know what to do or prepare for such a party. 

The real problem is that people ask me what I'm gonna do for my birthday etc. Whenever I tell someone that I haven't planned anything, they look overly surprised and I don't know what else to say. What am I supposed to do? Is the 18th birthday really a ""must-celebrate"" and will people be mad at me if I won't do it?

The strange thing is that they tend to be rather ruthless and fire people with little to no warning, for reasons that are questionably truthful.

I don't know what to do, because I know if I date her then I might get really depressed if things go wrong (I can get depressed now over really petty things that happen between us, as can she)

A couple of weeks ago, we met at a business event, she mentioned that she had a lots of stress at work, up to the point where she got sick at the beginning of the year. We also talked about a mutual friend who got seriously ill.

My question is, is it ok to text her to ask her how shes doing now? If everything turned out fine? 

Whats you opinion?

The problem is, I suspect that she is thinking I never got over her, and I dont want to make that impression. I still care, but not like that.

In all do honesty, his current music isn't what we're all fans of, but keep in mind, he's young. He can't sing about dramatic life experiences, breakups, or heart ache, because he hasn't experienced that yet. As he matures, so will his music, and once that's combined with his talents he has the potential to be outstanding.

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

I live in Ontario, Canada by the way.

I called the company, and he was really vague about who called him to boot my car. He said he thinks it was management, but a local office manages the property and they're across town. I've also parked in visitor parking hundreds of times, and even overnight. 

The thing is, I can't get a hold of management. No answer to my emails or phone calls. Any suggestions on what I can do?

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

I am currently involved in a start up with a friend and have another job on the side. I am able to pay my bills but only if I do not pay rent. That said, I have two jobs and pay my own way.

So, women of reddit, is it completely unattractive when a guy says he lives at home? Do you automatically peg him as a ""loser"" or not long-term material? I'm also trying online dating again and wonder if this is something I need to add to my profile as a ""disclaimer"".

TITLE: I have [26 year old male] no female friends. What should I do about this?
POST: I am a 26 yeard old straight male. I have always struggled to make female friends. It got slightly better during high school and I somehow made several female ""friends"" after high school. However in the last couple years everything has unraveled in that regard and I am back to square one with no female friends at all.
I'm not sure exactly how this happened but it has left me feeling extremely enraged and devastated. 

I'm not sure why I feel the intense need to have female frienship and company but it is killing me inside to not have any anymore. Every time in my life I have attempted to establish and maintain a female friendship my efforts have ended in disaster. Clearly this is due to my failings as a human being.

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

These dreams almost *always* involve me at least kissing, and sometimes banging, a dude who isn't my boyfriend. Sometimes it's someone I actually know, other times I've never seen him before.

I don't understand where this is stemming from. I'm an incredibly faithful woman and I would never dream (well, figuratively I guess) of cheating on my boyfriend. I love him and he completely satisfies me sexually, although I only get to see him once a month or so because we're long distance.

TITLE: Looking for insight : How do you estimate the cost of life in another country?
POST: So basicly, I'm French. 

In France, we have about 20% charges on the ""brut"" salary, which then gives us the real remuneration. For example, if your remuneration is **30k€/year**, that will make you **24k€/year real remuneration** (or 2k/month).

However, I've recently obtained a job interview for what could be a dream job in the gaming industry in **Ireland**.

So obviously one of the first questions I had to myself was : 

Well, how can I know what will the life cost in another country? That way I would know better what to ask as a salary during my job interview.

Other than that, there is a lot of information to be found (like the cost of a flat, the taxes, etc) and I have only 2 days to get everything.

TITLE: How Do I Come Out More Mature?
POST: I did a stupid thing and dated within my friends circle. I know, I know. Lesson Learned. But now I have a new problem.

This group of friends go out for breakfast every Saturday Morning. It's become a tradition that we've come to look forward to. We go to the same delicious restaurant with fair prices, and the wait staff knows us all by name.

My ex and I continued to attend after the breakup. We looked past the awkwardness because the tradition had become so important (and fun!). But now a new obstacle has presented itself. He has acquired a new girlfriend who has no taste for my presence. Thus, he set an ultimatum for our friends circle: It's either him or me.

What do I do? Do I continue to go with my nose high, saying that he can stay home (since this is just childish)? Or do I put my pride to work, and step back so as to avoid any of this ridiculousness? Which option would make me more mature?

TITLE: Separate or stay together during marriage counseling? M31, F27, married 2 years
POST: My wife and I have had our share of ups and downs for the past 2 years we've been married.  We recently ""separated"" for 11 days, and I just returned home.  We talked a lot, and agreed we have some real issues.  Primarily, she has trust issues with me.  Since I've been home (one night) things have been great between us, when we don't directly discuss our marriage.  Even our sex life has been on a totally new level.

We are going to go through marriage counseling weekly at least.  During that period, we are entertaining her moving out to a nearby apartment while I stay in the home.  We will still be married and committed to each other, just not living together.  Is this a normal thing to do?  Is this a good thing to do?  Or would that just be the start of the end?

Thanks in advance, everyone!

I have been with my GF for 7 months soon.
I'm her first ever boyfriend and first guy she's even dated.
She has told me she loves me and I've told her the same, and I truly thought we both meant it.
In the past 3 - 4 weeks we have been constantly fighting, she seems to be attacking me on little things at every turn and no longer making seeing me a priority.
I understand that she has her own life and that outside of me but recently we have gone from seeing each other 3 - 4 times a week to 1 - 2 and she doesn't seem to be really upset by this.

Both of us are dealing with things outside the relationship and letting it interfere with how we are around each other a lot as well but I feel like that's nothing new for a lot of couples. 

We have tried talking about it and it just ends in a fight and her shifting the responsibility on to me.

TITLE: Reddit, can you identify this bug?
POST: I went camping in the BC interior last weekend, on the last day I kept feeling a prick in my leg and several times rolled up my pant leg to find it. I didnt find anything and assumed it was a small seed that has hooks on it stuck inside my pant leg, which has happened before. Fast forward 10hrs later to when I get home and take off my pants to have a shower, this bug crawls out. Not knowing if it will fly away and get lost in my house somewhere I quickly used my sock to grab it and take it outside. When I get outside it gets stuck inside my sock, it has several small barbs on its legs, which was the pricking i felt, finally get it out of my sock and put a glass over it. Now im trying to figure out what it is, in the 10 years I have been camping at the same place I have never seen it before. So Reddit, WTF is this thing?

TITLE: Reddit, I work for a large television provider in Canada. Our ""on hold"" music and voice overs kind of really suck. I want to fix this. I could use some help.
POST: Hi,

Long time redditor. Throwaway account. I do tech support via e-mail, from one of our call centers. It's not the best job in the world, but I love the company I work for. I am also a customer of many other large business, and I HATE IVR's and shitty hold music. Ours is pretty bad, and loops constantly. It pisses people off more than it helps. 

I have a chance to change that. I have the opportunity to put together some suggestions to improve it, and have someone with actual say; evaluate it and possibly run with it.

My question to you Reddit is; what do you think would make decent hold music and voice overs? Alternatively, what upsets you the most with them? (my pet peeve is Christmas music). 

Please, if anyone have any suggestions or input, I'm all eyes. Thank you.

Okay, so I was in a relationship for 7 years (15-22) with someone. While we dated I put in all the effort, arranged fun dates and tried really hard to be the best gf I could be. He put in no effort and arranged no fun dates. I dated around with a few guys between 22-24, nothing longer than a few dates each. Now I'm with someone who I'm pretty serious about, dating 8 months now.

 In my first relationship I made it a pretty annual thing that we would go on an adventure tour. The only years we skipped were years I asked him to book the tour and he forgot until it was too late and they were sold out for the year. (it only runs June-August).

For some reason I resist them at every turn, probably because I am a teenager and I don't want to listen to my parents. 

I have two reservations though: 1) I don't enjoy math even though I am good with it. But I am also scared of the rigor of engineering (I am not lazy though) 2) My first thought was to study econ because I want  to go to law school. But quite frankly I have no clue what I want to do. I do have a long term goal of becoming a politician, but that is far down the line.

TITLE: Help with my creepy coworker...
POST: I'm a grad student in a biomedical lab at a large university, and I've noticed that a new post-doc has been doing some very weird things.  A brief summary:

He printed out a court case about child sex abuse and requirements for being on the registered sex offenders list.

I once saw him visiting a sex offender registry website.

He obsessively changes every single computer in our lab he uses to auto-delete all web browsing history.  He checks this regularly.

He frequently blanks his screen when I walk by.

He is somewhat touchy and aggressive with undergrads he works with.

So, what can I do?  I'm thinking about installing some sort of logging software, because if he's doing something illegal with lab computers it could put all of our jobs at risk.  I don't know much about logging software or other possible approaches to this issue.

POST: Basically we met at uni, have a few classes together and seem to get on well. When we first met I had boyfriend, but i broke up with him a month ago and have been single ever since. We recently had a uni break and he added me on fb and we have chatted a few times. It all seems pretty good but I just can't read him. I can't tell if he just wants to be friends or more.

Should i be upfront with him? Ask him if he is interested or just wait. I know it's pretty early days, but I just don't like the feeling of waiting around for something that may never happen.
We kind of spoke about what we would want out of relationships, pretty casual/organic flowing but I couldn't tell if he was initiating anything or just for conversation :/

I just don't know if it's worth the stress or if it's what I really want. It kinda makes me sick to realize how much I think about it.

So in short, I really like this girl, she's everything you could want (attractive, musician, unbelievably friendly, dabbles in psychedelics) but she's dating my really good friend so I would never even attempt to pursue her. Anyways, she's out of my league, etc.

That's not really the issue here though. So everytime I've ever liked a girl, I've never been able to masturbate to them. All I feel is this sort of sad, longing feeling. Like I really want it but I can't have it. Here's the problem - I can't masturbate at all. This has happened before and it lasts months, which you can imagine is a huge problem. I can't think straight!

POST: I would like to say that I absolutely loved the first season of Game of Thrones. It was fantastic, and followed very closely to what the book represented. The season was so powerful that I found myself looking forward to the second season, which would represent Clash of Kings. However, I currently can barely sit through a single episode without cringing every other second. There are so many discrepancies and so many integral themes or motifs that are left out. Why are they doing this? Why are they tearing apart at the portion of the audience that knows and loves the books, when they followed them so closely in the previous season?

Does anyone else feel this way?

Sorry if this comes out as a rant. But I can't understand why they are doing this.

I've been talking to this girl for roughly two weeks now and we've gone on a handful of dates. If I had to describe the feeling, I'd say it's overwhelming. Overwhelming because I've never clicked/felt this strongly about anyone before and it's scary in a way.

If we're being honest, I feel like she is the one. But that's a conversation for another day.

Anyways, it's obvious we are both very into each other. She has sent me sweet texts saying how much she can't wait to see me again in between dates and we are both very comfortable with each other.

Now, since I like her so much and everything is going so well right now, my biggest fear is messing things up. Obviously I want to be official and have a real relationship with her, but I don't want to ""move too fast"" or rush things if that makes sense.

POST: My gf of two moths is still in contact with her most recent ex. They text each other once about 2 weeks or so and she has told me that she never initiates contact. He usually reaches out for some assistance with an insurance policy that they were both part of and some visa issues (he is an international) that she was helping him with before they broke up.

My gf tells me she feels nothing for him and just being nice and not rude as he was there for her during a tough time. I have told her to end it period and at least maintain no contact for a few months. She thinks I am making a big deal out of it and giving the issue more weight than its worth.

Thoughts?

TITLE: Can I claim myself as an independent if my father pays child support to my mother?
POST: I am an 18 year old male who attends and resides at a University while working part time. My mother has custody of me and my brother and receives child support from my father for us two. I pay for tuition, housing, food, and supplies from my own money and a combination of scholarships and loans taken out in my name and my name only.

TITLE: Help with my creepy coworker...
POST: I'm a grad student in a biomedical lab at a large university, and I've noticed that a new post-doc has been doing some very weird things.  A brief summary:

He printed out a court case about child sex abuse and requirements for being on the registered sex offenders list.

I once saw him visiting a sex offender registry website.

He obsessively changes every single computer in our lab he uses to auto-delete all web browsing history.  He checks this regularly.

He frequently blanks his screen when I walk by.

He is somewhat touchy and aggressive with undergrads he works with.

So, what can I do?  I'm thinking about installing some sort of logging software, because if he's doing something illegal with lab computers it could put all of our jobs at risk.  I don't know much about logging software or other possible approaches to this issue.

TITLE: Negotating pay rise/better conditions in current job - how to do it, what tips?
POST: Hi Reddit,

I work 30 hours a week, for which I'm paid at around the going rate.

I have a job on the side, which I'm allowed to do when I take holiday from my work.

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I'd appreciate tips on strategy about how to achieve this… and am sure that the kind and wise folk on self.jobs can help me in my goal!

So, dear chefs, how do you all go about making fried banana peppers? It should be noted that I own a deep fryer.

He is always shouting ""Are you serious?! Oh my god!  That's a fucking red, ref!"" and stuff like that.  He bangs his table sometimes.  And he's just watching soccer alone.  It would be less unusual to me if he were sharing it with his friends and they were all getting riled up.  But it is just him on his laptop, yelling at his laptop.

I have been with my GF for 7 months soon.

She has told me she loves me and I've told her the same, and I truly thought we both meant it.
In the past 3 - 4 weeks we have been constantly fighting, she seems to be attacking me on little things at every turn and no longer making seeing me a priority.
I understand that she has her own life and that outside of me but recently we have gone from seeing each other 3 - 4 times a week to 1 - 2 and she doesn't seem to be really upset by this.

Both of us are dealing with things outside the relationship and letting it interfere with how we are around each other a lot as well but I feel like that's nothing new for a lot of couples.

POST: I am going to college next year:

Ever since I was a little kid I have been playing with legos, building stupid things, and most recently built a computer. (I know none of these things qualify me as an engineer.) My physics teacher says I would make a great engineer, and my parents have been encouraging me for the past 4 years to become one. For some reason I resist them at every turn, probably because I am a teenager and I don't want to listen to my parents. 

I have two reservations though: 1) I don't enjoy math even though I am good with it. But I am also scared of the rigor of engineering (I am not lazy though) 2) My first thought was to study econ because I want  to go to law school. But quite frankly I have no clue what I want to do. I do have a long term goal of becoming a politician, but that is far down the line.

POST: So I've noticed that anytime things start to get serious with a girl, I tend to have the habit of cutting it off and backing away before things get serious to avoid getting hurt. 

In this particular case, we've been seeing each other for about almost a month, fairly often. Both of us opened up about how we feel for each other.

 I think she's awesome and there's definitely some potential there, but I just start to have all these thoughts about why I should cut it off so I don't end up hurt.

How can I avoid this feeling? I never know how to distinguish if it's a 'gut feeling' or me being paranoid..

TITLE: Can I forcefully take control of my father's finances?
POST: Hey reddit! I grew up with a father who is on long term disabilty and because he is so down about his life he has gotten involved in crack. It really wasn't bad for the first few years but now, at year 7, he refuses to admit there's a problem. My parents have been without tv/phone/cable for 4 months now, they sometimes don't have electric, and they've had a car repoed. My father has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety disorder as well. throughout my childhood he and I often got into fights and one time he even came after me with a knife. The last year or so he has also tried to kill himself on multiple occasions. So my question is... Is there a way I can forcefully take over his finances? I have a lot of evidence to be able to deem him mentally incapassable, which should then make it easy for a court to award me control over his finances if I were to try correct?

POST: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 10 months now. And we literally just broke up 30 minutes ago. What happened was that we both realized we were different. She thought we wanted different things. I thought that we loved a person differently(ie. I felt she didn't love me the same way I loved her). Now I feel incredibly ok. Not that im ecstatic but I feel a lot better(we had broken up twice before and got back together each time). I think it's because I finally realized that we're different and love each other differently. So reddit, have you had any similar experiences where you felt surprisingly fine after a break up? If so, did you know why?
P.S. we are still best friends and we are going to maintain a close relationship purely as friends.

TITLE: I'm black, she's white (from Europe)... parents are slightly racist. What do I do?
POST: So I've been talking to a girl (Eastern European)for about three months now and we're both 19. It's starting to get rather serious but before we started talking she warned me that her parents (father especially) would disapprove of her dating outside her ethnicity. She also said that she'd probably have to keep it (the relationship) a secret from her parents. It didn't really phase me at the time because of how early the stage of the ""relationship"" between the two of us was, how ever now it is really bugging me. I think the only thing preventing me from asking her out is the situation with her parents. I'm worried that if I do start dating her, I wouldn't want it to be a secret from her parents.

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?
