TITLE: Reddit, where do you shop for (semi-nice) casual clothes?
POST: I am starting grad school soon in le big city and I don't want everyone to *immediately* know that I am a poor country bumpkin. I have formal clothes (nice suit/dress shirts/slacks), but I am at a loss when it comes to casual wear. I typically sport old band tshirts, dickies type shorts and canvas shoes; basically I've had little need to update my attire since ~2002. Everything has holes in it :/ and this has never bothered me till now (I am a little perturbed that it should bother me at all).

Does anyone live in nyc, have any idea where to shop (pref. online) for early 20's semi-professional kind of look? Is this even how grad students dress?

Neither of us were interested in having an affair but after another month we started spending a lot of time together.  Eventually she felt that we should have some space from each other, which I reluctantly agreed with.  Looking back now I see that it was the right decision but at the time it really hurt.

He has bad teeth, is overweight and has some other physical issues (acne etc.). He is however a wonderful, sweet person with a very giving personality.

I work 30 hours a week, for which I'm paid at around the going rate.

I have a job on the side, which I'm allowed to do when I take holiday from my work.

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I'd appreciate tips on strategy about how to achieve this… and am sure that the kind and wise folk on self.jobs can help me in my goal!

I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June.

After all the advice I got from you all and my attorneys office I emailed the ex to state that I would require public visits until we have an independent supervisor in place mutually or appointed by the court.

Her expectation is that the visit tomorrow will be at her house. But obviously I am uncomfortable with that considering she called the police on me at my own home for a ""perceived"" threat which the police apparently found baseless since they didn't make a report and left.

The problem is that everything seems to remind me of her. Almost anything I do or see brings back some memory of her. I'll see some food and remember that was a food she liked, and just like that, she's back in my head. 

Sometimes it'll be some memory that comes up out of the blue. I'll be doing nothing and I'll remember the time we went out on a date somewhere or some other time we spent together.

Is there a way to stop this, or is it just something that will go away with time. I know that I can't just wipe her from my memory, she'll always be there, but is there a way to make it happen less, or hurt less? I know I could get over her much easier if I was able to get her out of my head.

I then realized that I really do have feelings for her like I actually liked her. I asked her out and she said yes. We have been together for a month now.

The problem started toward the 3 week mark of our relationship. She always says that other girls are so much prettier then her and she doesn't know why I'm with her and not these other girls because they're so much better then her.

POST: The title is pretty self explanatory. We have been together for about 18 months now and I am damn near losing my mind. He's a great guy and easily the best person I've ever dated, but his laugh makes me want to tear my hair out. It also doesn't help that he laughs after nearly everything he or anyone else says. It's the same every time, a short but extremely loud, ""ah-huh-huh-huh."" He literally sounds like a cartoon character. 

I don't want to tell him that his laugh is annoying, because you can't really control that very well and that's a hurtful thing to hear, but at the same time I am afraid I'll accidentally rage strangle him next time someone tells a joke.

As long as I've known them they've kept him confined to a cage (inside) 24/7, besides taking him for walks. They say they do this because he's very territorial and marks everything.

I can't really believe they weren't true feelings in the first place because it' not just a matter of weeks, sometimes it can be years. And I don't get over it only by sleeping with the person, sometimes it's just a kiss or a declaration that makes it go away. 

So I'm tired of acting like a bitch, because yeah that's kind of the word that describes acting like you're madly in love and the next day forgetting the person. But really it's not deliberate. I'm really into the person and then intimacy shows up and I can't deal with it. I try not to show it but of course at some point it's obvious.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

They go to these parties with this special swinging group at least once a month, and I've met the people that attend these parties. I now cannot help but feel awkward about all this.

TITLE: Confused nonresident alien bought bonds as a resident alien
POST: I did not see a ""fix a blunder"" weekly thread so I am posting this as a separate one.

I am a student on an F-1 Visa in the US. I wanted to buy short term bonds online from solarcity instead of keeping my all my savings in the bank. I did so, however at the checkout page it asked me to confirm that I am a resident alien.

I wrongly thought that I am a resident alien because I fulfill the ""substantial presence test"". What I did not know is that F-1 Visa holders are exempt from that test. I learned this only after buying the bonds. What should I do now?

I think only the IRS cares about this, but I would not want to anger them.

TITLE: Does my friend have LEG CANCER?!
POST: My friend and I were about to go get some food at 11 PM when he was resting his legs on my own. I was resting my hand on his leg and felt a weird bump below his kneecap. Upon lifting his pants-leg (which was totally fucking gay) and looking at it, closer inspection revealed that it was a mass of bone.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

So.... Anyone want to tell him that mass of bone isn't normal / tell us what it is? I'm aware of the Kneecap and the smaller kneecap-like bone behind it that helps facilitate movement, but this is below his kneecap, IE his leg doesn't run smoothly down, it has a jagged ridge of bone below his kneecap for a few inches before evening out.

Any ideas what it is?

POST: We've been together for 5 months now, and I'd initiate most of the contact between us. She's really passionate about the relationship and I can tell that she enjoys being around me, but sometimes it's like she's not interested at all.

Obviously I've been suppressing this and forcing myself to text her less and so on, but should I just tell her frankly how I feel?

It's her first relationship, so I've been assuming she's not used to the concept, which explains the way she acts. Am I wrong?

I would've told her how I feel ages ago, but she mentioned that she turned this guy down before we started dating because he ""needed too much attention"". Should that affect my actions?

TITLE: How I fight hunger cravings.
POST: Aside from the standard stuff I've seen around here, like drinking water or filling up on really dense/low calorie food, I've realized a method that works for me to avoid feeling hunger pangs.

I noticed that during the week, when I'm watching TV or browsing reddit, I tend to get hungrier more often. I just want to eat when I know I shouldn't. But on the weekends I eat less than I usually do and don't seem to get hungry. I still browse the internet and watch TV probably a similar amount, but it's when I have free time and when I also do something else: play videogames.

Something about focusing or getting entirely absorbed in a good game somehow gets me through a whole day, almost forgetting to eat. I've experienced the same thing when reading or writing something, anything that gets me to focus all of my attention on it.

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

POST: I'm 23, horrible at flirting, never had a gf, blah blah blah.  NO idea how to flirt.  I've asked several of my friends and they all pretty much say that I should be suggestive.  So I sent a girl (probably 20-ish), who's number I got a week ago, this:

""So you don't have work today and I don't have work today.  Are you thinking what I'm thinking? :)"" 

Because women love smiley faces right?...Right?

She responds with ""I'm at work pal.  I close, but it's nice to hear your off.  I hope your enjoying your day off.  I'm going back to work from lunch.""

Asked a female friend and she says that the girl was obviously NOT happy with my text and that I was being TOO suggestive...upon review I got the same feeling.  So after lurking for a couple years I decided to make an account to get a consensus on how to flirt.

TITLE: How do you keep the interest going in a relationship? How do you get over being only interested in the ""chasing"" part?
POST: I've had a problem since I started dating, I lose the interest in the other person as soon as I know how they feel about me. I can obsess over someone for months but when the other person gets close BOOM all the feelings disappear. 

I can't really believe they weren't true feelings in the first place because it' not just a matter of weeks, sometimes it can be years. And I don't get over it only by sleeping with the person, sometimes it's just a kiss or a declaration that makes it go away. 

So I'm tired of acting like a bitch, because yeah that's kind of the word that describes acting like you're madly in love and the next day forgetting the person. But really it's not deliberate. I'm really into the person and then intimacy shows up and I can't deal with it. I try not to show it but of course at some point it's obvious.

We hang out on the weekends, text everyday, and share a few classes with each other. Initially, I didn't harbor feelings for him and would give him dating advice.

We broke up in June. It wasn't easy for me. I didn't feel like I got enough closure and she just dropped off the face of the earth. 

Well I've been dating this new girl called T for a month or so and shes great, tall, blonde, sweet, gorgeous, looks like Blake Lively sp?. I know that in most situations this would be great, my ex saw me with a gorgeous girl and I looked happy.

But I dont feel good about it, I dont feel like I won something. I feel bad because I still care a lot about her (the ex) and I wish we were still friends. Should I just continue the no contact, or should I reach out and see if she wants coffee sometime? I already broke the no contact, I sent her a small email that just said ""You look good"". No reply.

Recently I was traveling across the country with my girlfriend and we stopped to talk to many of her friends and mine along the way. We meet up with one of her friends that is always obsessing over guys, and then complaining about how she cannot find Mr. Perfect.

She goes on to talk about how she met a guy that slept with her and then she stole his underwear. She went on to say that every time she is in the bathroom it is like their smells come together as one. We were sitting at a restaurant and as soon as the waiter leaves us she lifts up her dress to show that in fact she is wearing the underwear right that second. I about died.

I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June.

POST: Original post: 

I really did read all of your comments, and thank you. I was pretty upset and didn't do much responding. It was definitely trickle truth. Each time I pushed her, more stuff came out. It was definitely a longer term thing, definitely physical on more than one occasion. 

I told her she couldn't work with him, and she shouldn't want to if what she was saying was true. She agreed. She agreed to counseling. She also agreed to give me access to all of her texts, emails, phone, etc. in real time (there's an app for that) She wants to work things out - especially since we have two kids under 2. 

As for me, I have to figure out how to get past it, how to forgive, and how not to be a giant sucker. I think that last one may be the hardest. Any words of wisdom are definitely appreciated.

I told some serious whoppers in my time.

The week before my ex and I split, I spent some time at a hotel room with this guy I knew, anyway we hung out and..you know. Had sex.
Suffice to say my neck was covered in huge Hickeys that were EXTREMELY visible, and had turned into a dark red discolouration by the morning. 

So when I got home and saw my partner I looked her straight in the eye and said 'oh god, I got bit by a spider last night when I was walking to the shops!'. I felt so incredibly guilty and horrible for it. But she somehow believed me.

We broke up shortly afterwards because I couldn't stand the fact I was cheating on her, and because we were all kinds of wrong for each other. But that is another story.

TITLE: Me [19 M] with my Friend? [18 F] a month, just curious on what yall think.
POST: So there is this Girl I am going to school with and she's interesting, I enjoy talking to her, and hanging out with her pretty often. we flirt and its kind of obvious and like hold on to each other while watching tv sitting or laying down. But the fact that neither of us are sure what we are looking for and that I don't have the time to commit to someone makes for an interesting dynamic. I have conflicted feelings because I do like her but I dont know what to do with that. So far ive just been kind of backing off and trying to talk to other people but its hard to meet new people during the exams this week. Im thinking about just stopping the flirting and what not because Im not sure what I want, and I know her opinion. what do yall think?

TITLE: Me [21 M] with my GF [20 F] GF wont make it facebook official
POST: We've been together for 4 months. I know this is really trivial and everyone knows I'm with my GF. I would just like to make it facebook official because I want to show the world my amazing GF. I want everyone to know. She says she doesn't want to do it because of privacy and I respect that. It also makes me think she wants to like hide me. I tried discussing it with her. It just makes me think because this day and age of social media when people don't do this its because they are ashamed of being with you or they have someone else.

TITLE: [25/m] I am currently dating a girl(23) and I don't know if she is cheating on me or not.
POST: I have only been dating this girl for about a month. She doesn't want to make anything 'official' or have titles because she wants to take things slow. we have already slept together and see each other 2-3 times week. This past week over Thanksgiving break from school we didn't talk much because I went back home. She has told me that she will not be able to see me for a couple days she has made other plans. The part that makes me worry is that there is another guy in our class that openly talks about how he likes her. Tonight she drove him home. I have expressed my insecurities to her about this before but she tells me not to worry. Since I haven't spent time with her since before break I am starting to get worried but I don't know if I'm just creating my own nightmare.

TITLE: Does having the same ""level of intelligence"" make a date more successful?
POST: 18f here, and I've been talking to a guy who is 19. I go to a really good university and I'm studying Physics. We met about 2 months ago and he texts me a lot. We're supposed to hang out when I go back for second semester.

Here's the problem: He's not smart. He's almost at the point where I'd call him stupid. It sounds awful, but it's true. However, he's incredibly nice and charming. We have stuff in common such as skiing/snowboarding and other outdoorsy things but I'm worried that we'll have nothing to talk about besides that. I've always been friends with smart kids (nerds, basically). Does anyone have any insight into whether this sort of match generally works out? I don't want to waste his time or mine and I don't want to lead him on if there's no hope.

TITLE: I [19 M], will be stuck on a farm with my [20 F] girlfriend's ex-girlfriend [19(?) F] all summer.
POST: I'm a college student, and about a month ago I entered into a long-distance relationship (and my first relationship in general) with a girl I met on Facebook a year ago. (I realize that that in itself is strange, but things are going quite well so far, so I'm not worried about it). 

I wound up applying to intern on a sustainable farm this summer, and got accepted. When I got the acceptance email, however, I discovered that my girlfriend's ex (who goes to the same school as I do) will also be interning there.

So basically, I'm going to be stuck all summer at a tiny farm with my girlfriend's ex. There are a total of four interns there, so I can't really avoid her. The thing is, she doesn't know that my gf and I are together. Should I tell her beforehand, and if so, how? Or am I better off just keeping things a secret?
