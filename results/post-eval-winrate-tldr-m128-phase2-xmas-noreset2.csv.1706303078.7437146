POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Today she texted me that she really cares about me and is scared that this will make me hate her but that she doesn't want to rush into another relationship so quickly and told me she needs some time to sort out her life. I asked her if this meant we needed to take it slower or if it was over and she said to give her some time before we start talking again. I told her that I would be here when she felt she was ready.

My question to you guys/gals is this, Is this relationship over for good or is there any hope for us?

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?

3 weeks ago we were hanging out. A lot of bottles of wine was consumed between us,and we started to make out for the first time.  Making out as in a lot of kissing with tongue, hugging and touching of bodies of the non sexual parts. About 30 minutes in, she said ""I want to feel you."" Initially I thought this as having intercourse but wasn't sure. i asked, ""you mean have sex?""

Apparently me asking this killed the mood for her. I don't feel I was wrong for asking because we were both still pretty buzzed and since I felt she was out if it, I had to ask. No intercourse happen that night but would you, as a female, feel rejected or have any other negative feelings based on my actions?

This group of friends go out for breakfast every Saturday Morning. It's become a tradition that we've come to look forward to. We go to the same delicious restaurant with fair prices, and the wait staff knows us all by name.

My ex and I continued to attend after the breakup. We looked past the awkwardness because the tradition had become so important (and fun!). But now a new obstacle has presented itself. He has acquired a new girlfriend who has no taste for my presence. Thus, he set an ultimatum for our friends circle: It's either him or me.

What do I do? Do I continue to go with my nose high, saying that he can stay home (since this is just childish)? Or do I put my pride to work, and step back so as to avoid any of this ridiculousness? Which option would make me more mature?

While friendly, she isn't flirty, responsive to my flirtations or has been warm towards me at all. My mom thinks it's because I missed an opportunity to meet her family (she mentioned that she wanted me to meet her family on a public holiday that passed while I was away a few weeks ago), is afraid I might leave, or I said something to hurt her. 

Of course she could have cold feet as it's a one month old relationship, but that's just me being negative.

That said, when I returned home, all of her toiletaries were gone from my bathroom. She had been looking after my cat for me while I was away, and it's a bit of a shock for me.

POST: Alright, so I've[25] started dating with a girl[23] from uni. It's all been fun and whatnot, but we were pretty cautious about calling ourselves a couple, both had some previous stuff mess up our heads. We've had a crush on each other since october, but started really acting on things ~2 months ago. Now, it has steadily evolved and we seem perfectly fine and happy and all that jazz, but recently I've been feeling that something's not right. Everything is seemingly perfectly fine, but for some reason I get the idea stuck in my head she's not as involved as she usually would. I wouldn't want to seem like I'm trying too hard or am too invasive too, which makes me unsure how to act. I have a history of overthinking and worry I might just be paranoid, which will lead me to trying too hard or something.

Any advice Redditors? I REALLY wouldn't want this one to go well.

A few days ago he got super upset bc I didn't tell him I went on a date... It didn't go too great do I never said anything. Then recently he got mad bc I said I missed having sex.

At first my goal was to try to talk to him and see if we could make it work. I really don't think that is going to work this time. So since reforming a relationship/any kind of dating is out of the question I would like to try friends with benefits. Because that would be better than nothing. I am pretty sure he's on the fence about it, but does anyone have any advice about things I could say during our conversation to help convince him it's a good idea?

I have been with my GF for 7 months soon.
I'm her first ever boyfriend and first guy she's even dated.
She has told me she loves me and I've told her the same, and I truly thought we both meant it.
In the past 3 - 4 weeks we have been constantly fighting, she seems to be attacking me on little things at every turn and no longer making seeing me a priority.
I understand that she has her own life and that outside of me but recently we have gone from seeing each other 3 - 4 times a week to 1 - 2 and she doesn't seem to be really upset by this.

Both of us are dealing with things outside the relationship and letting it interfere with how we are around each other a lot as well but I feel like that's nothing new for a lot of couples. 

We have tried talking about it and it just ends in a fight and her shifting the responsibility on to me.

POST: I am (attempting) to run the Charlottesville Half Marathon ( my first race) on April 7th. Always played team sports (lax) but now post college have been working on running.  My longest run thus far has been 8 miles, last weekend. I added 2 miles last week because I have been behind schedule and was planning to do the same today (run 10 miles).

 The week prior to the 8 mile run  I had to skip a week of training due to illness. Today I am supposed to do another long distance run but I am feeling achy and fatigued. 

Do I do the run and take it easy? Should I rest? Am I totally fucked for running this race with all these training interruptions? Would appreciate reddit's expert advice! 

Also, this is the program I have been using:

POST: Hello Reddit!
Last october I told this girl my feelings towards her, but her response was what I've known but I had a lot to go through so I went along. Yes, it was a No. We were really close best friends, but for the past 2 years I felt a lot more( this as background). We've known each other for 9 years now, we were dating at the very beginning. I told her that I can't see her in order to help myself forget and move on, so I asked her not to write me or call me. Today is/was my birthday, and she wrote me, and told me the she's sorry to break my wish, but it's my birthday so she had to write. It pains me, I have to admit that she wrote me, I feel very down once again. The question I want to ask is, whether I should her write back anything at all or no? We are mature and quite different from our generation.
Thanks in advance!

I (F23) attended a university for 4 years, yet never graduated. Mental, emotional, and physical stress towards the end of my senior year caused me to not return to classes. I never officially withdrew from the university, just never signed up for next semester. I proceeded to pretend I was a university graduate, but without a piece of paper to back me up.

We managed to form some semblance of a friendship. Granted I have to do all the calling, asking, waiting and planning for us to hangout. 

Now you would think that if he was going to go off and get a girlfriend he would tell me. We hangout  every other week so you would think he would mention this. Nope! Didn't mention it once. 

Now when we go out everyone thinks we are together. Walking close, whispering in my ear, the accidental bumps into me. Constantly looking at me big pouting eyes.

TITLE: Went on a date yesterday and felt guilty the whole time.
POST: My boyfriend broke up with me about 3 weeks ago. It's been a hard time but I'm starting to feel myself again. I am still in contact with him, but we are keeping it friendly and platonic. 

Last week, I met a really great guy and we got to talking. We got along instantly, and he asked me out. Last night he made me dinner, things were going great, but then he kissed me. I felt so overcome with guilt and sadness.

I know I'm not in a relationship with my ex anymore, but it felt as though I was cheating. I might (don't yell at me for this) be holding on to a tiny bit of hope that me and my ex will get back together eventually.

Is it too soon to be dating? Should I stop seeing this new guy even though he's amazing? I'm most definitely not over my ex yet. Do I have to tell him about this new guy? I really don't want to hurt anybody. 

Very confused!!

I've been under an incredible amount of stress lately and I had a meltdown.  I ended up punching a dumpster and couldn't hold back my emotions.  I didn't hurt her in any physical way, but she's angry at me.

The basis for her anger is that I ""don't have good coping skills.""

on average, i'd say I have 1 or 2 big ""meltdowns"" a year and the rest of the time I am totally normal and she's told me repeatedly that I am ""the most patient person she knows.""

Am I allowed to freak out?  I know ""allowed"" isn't really the right word.  I don't channel any anger towards her when I'm under a lot of stress.  at least I don't think I do.

But silliness aside, how much flak do you think I'm likely to get for this, whether to my face or behind my back? I've heard guys a year younger than me say 19 is too young, so I'm a bit worried about it.

To be clear, I see no earthly reason why maturity should be an issue. She's wrapped up three semesters of university with the most recent being spent living abroad, and I feel like I'm somewhat behind where I ""should be"" in the maturity game since I spent three years (from Grade 12 until the summer after my second year of university) being pretty much too depressed to leave my room.

So, should I ask her out?

So, basically i need some advice. After leaving High School (2 years ago) i decided to get a job working for a food chain company (first ever job). Worked their for 3 months or so and decided to leave and go to University however, while leaving i didn't have the most positive experience.

Now, finishing the first semester of uni, i found out that my Overseas trip (planned before starting uni and said to be OK by the Uni) would in fact not be OK and that No matter what i could do, my week long trip would result in failing of all papers that semester. (Uni refunded costs of semester after much debate)

So, its now been 7 months since i have been working or studying. I decided a month ago, i wouldn't return to Uni This Semester (just over it and needed a break). I currently owe about 12000 in student loan and 3000 or so to my parents who lent me some money and i need some advice.

However, during the celebrations I grabbed a close friends boob and gave it a little squeeze. I regret my action and I think a few people saw.  I had none at the time nor have any sexual feelings towards my friend and I apologised to her the next day. She laughed saying I was extremely drunk and she didn't feel awkward regarding it.

I feel guilty since this could hurt my relationship. Should I tell my girlfriend or only address this silly mistake if someone else mentions it?

The strange thing is that they tend to be rather ruthless and fire people with little to no warning, for reasons that are questionably truthful.
However, instead of jumping for joy, I feel saddened and a little depressed. I even thought about taking back my notice of resignation because of how saddened they seemed.
The closest feeling I can think of that's similar is when I break-up with some who is obviously not a good fit for me. Which is usually followed by doubts about whether or not I should get back with my ex.

POST: So I got with this girl at a student event in the city,
I've been to her flat a few times and things have gone quite well,
We've been talking frequently and we both know that we like each other (will elaborate shortly)
Recently, we've just been talking less and less to the point where I end up waiting hours for a reply from her OR I end up abandoning my previous message and sending a new one entirely.
This is made worse by the fact that my mind has a tendency to make a mountain out of a molehill and think of worse case scenarios that just make me get upset and all that other bullshit.
I told her yesterday straight forward that I like her, to which she told me the same & that she wanted to see how things go, yet nothing has changed (still waiting on a reply to a text I sent 4 hours ago + a text i sent 20 minutes ago)
The fuck have i done wrong/should i do.

Specifically, we refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend and on previous occasions she has made mention as to how I am ""hers"". However, on our second date, she let me know that she does in fact have a girlfriend who lives about 40 miles away. She said that they were ""in love"" yet she could ""still develop deep feelings for [me]"". However, things have come to a head for me this past week, as she has taken off for the entire week to be with that girl. Furthermore, she has made a big show of sending me pictures of them together, some where that girl has her hands all over my girlfriend. In the end, I suppose I feel cheated on. I am reasonably sure that an ultimatum would be fruitless, as she'd just choose the girl. Any advice would be incredibly appreciated.

POST: Hey, so its been two years, she met new guys, I met new women. When we see each other we talk casually about work, how we've been and so on. We didnt remain friends, which is totally fine by me, but still we care. A couple of weeks ago, we met at a business event, she mentioned that she had a lots of stress at work, up to the point where she got sick at the beginning of the year. We also talked about a mutual friend who got seriously ill.

My question is, is it ok to text her to ask her how shes doing now? If everything turned out fine? 

Whats you opinion?

The problem is, I suspect that she is thinking I never got over her, and I dont want to make that impression. I still care, but not like that.

This group of friends go out for breakfast every Saturday Morning. It's become a tradition that we've come to look forward to. We go to the same delicious restaurant with fair prices, and the wait staff knows us all by name.

My ex and I continued to attend after the breakup. We looked past the awkwardness because the tradition had become so important (and fun!). But now a new obstacle has presented itself. He has acquired a new girlfriend who has no taste for my presence. Thus, he set an ultimatum for our friends circle: It's either him or me.

What do I do? Do I continue to go with my nose high, saying that he can stay home (since this is just childish)? Or do I put my pride to work, and step back so as to avoid any of this ridiculousness? Which option would make me more mature?

- People who took a look at their actions, made some corrections, and want to try to patch things up

TITLE: My [24,F] boyfriend [26] of almost a year very rarely kisses me... should I be concerned?
POST: Yes, we have talked about it.  He will give me quick pecks no problem, but we have never, ever ""made out"".  Kissing is super intimate for me and I can never get him to do it longer than 3 or 4 seconds before he is trying to get away.  

He claims (and I believe him) that he has a deviated septum and it makes it hard for him to breathe when kissing me, and that he finds kissing to be a bit unnatural and weird anyways.

Does this seem legitimate or like something I should push?  He is very introverted and not very intimate anyways, so it just sucks that I can't even really make out with him.  Maybe I'm being childish... but that's why I'm asking y'all.  Thanks!

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

A lot of people are aware of this happening, including the close friends of the guy who got cheated on, the guy still knows nothing about it. I feel like if I was the one to tell him it would obviously be detrimental to a relationship that's half a decade old, but unfortunately, also to the guy's relationship with all of his friends that chose to keep him in the dark this whole time.

By telling him I feel I'd be causing the guy unnecessary pain... But on the other hand, maybe I'm this guy's only chance to avoid him going down a long dark road which he may choose to avoid given he knows all the facts.

I really don't want to because I've been dating her for 4 years and I really think she is the one because I love her immensely (sorry to get sappy reddit) and can't think about being without her, but people have always said these relationships don't work out and even she is skeptical but I want to try.

POST: Hey guys first time posting here. Im currently in a 2 year old relationship with whom i know is the one. She talks to me about the future she wants with me, how much she loves and cares for me, and how I'm the only one that made her this happy, the adventures she wants to do, etc. 3 Days ago she says she's confused about who she is, thought about breaking up to find herself. 

My question is, how do i help her find herself and not push her to the point of break up. We're still together and she still wants to act as a couple but needs to find herself. What do i do? what should she do? Any help would be appreciated. She is my life and i can't loose someone that means the world to me.

The title explains most of it, but I have a very strong attraction to one of my husband's coworkers, who we often hang out with and spend time with.
