TITLE: Me [M23] grabbing coffee with ex [F22]. Not sure how to proceed.
POST: Long story short, broke up with my ex gf last year. I broke it off because we both got busy and we weren't really spending time together or having a sexual relationship.

Even though i broke up with her, I never stopped missing her. I tried a few times after to reconcile with her but it went nowhere. I talked to her recently and she was responsive. She agreed to grab coffee but had to cancel due to being insanely busy with work. I told her to get back to me when her schedule allowed it.

She canceled about 10 days ago and I haven't heard from her since. Is it worth reaching out or should I leave the ball in her court?

TITLE: How long to ""date"" until you become official? I am [25/m], she's 24.
POST: Hey Reddit, first post. Hope you guys can help.

I've been talking to this girl for roughly two weeks now and we've gone on a handful of dates. If I had to describe the feeling, I'd say it's overwhelming. Overwhelming because I've never clicked/felt this strongly about anyone before and it's scary in a way.

If we're being honest, I feel like she is the one. But that's a conversation for another day.

Anyways, it's obvious we are both very into each other. She has sent me sweet texts saying how much she can't wait to see me again in between dates and we are both very comfortable with each other.

Now, since I like her so much and everything is going so well right now, my biggest fear is messing things up. Obviously I want to be official and have a real relationship with her, but I don't want to ""move too fast"" or rush things if that makes sense.

TITLE: Should I [29F] date my colleague [39 ]?
POST: (Note: I'm changing the academic field here and using equivalents)

I'm a graduate student in social work and also TA in the sociology department. There is a professor (39 m) in the office next to mine. He teaches critical race theory and I've never taken a class with him. His research interests are not related to mine at all. We always end up chatting about random things and I enjoy being friendly with him. He's really nice. I'm getting a pretty strong vibe he has a thing for me. He's tried to ask me indirectly if I have a boyfriend and seems really nervous when he initiates conversations with me. He's never been creepy or acted like a predator. 

He's always interacted with me as a friend or colleague, never as a student. I would like to ask him out, but I worry about two issues. 1) He is assistant head of the sociology department. 2.) It's always awkward to date your sort of colleague.

We feel like a married couple, but our families and friends keep asking when we're going to get married, why we don't want to get married, want to know if we're having problems and things like that. We think marriage is really a huge thing, especially here (Italy), where getting a divorce takes at least 3 years and quite some money spending, besides that we wouldn't have problems getting married, but we talked about it and what came out of it was: if we never thought about it, there must be a reason. I'm scared we're going to rush trough it just because ""it's the right thing to do"" and it'll damage our relationship.

The desire to save money has fueled my research to find a different solution, and recently I stumbled on this article: 

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

POST: OK, so here's the deal. About a month ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, we were doing the whole long-distance thing. In the moment I was completely taken by emotions,(hormones too.) and I told her how much I cared for her, even told her I loved her.(First time I've ever said that to a girl.) In response, she told me she didn't feel the same anymore, and she just wanted to be friends.

She had started to become distant weeks before, and I knew it wasn't working... Anyway, several days ago, she sent me a email, asking to talk on Skype. So I accepted, and the next day we talk. All she wanted to do was have small talk. I was fairly offended, and cut her off, and logged off. At this point, I'm not really sure what I should do next. And I was hoping Reddit could give me some ideas, or whatever.

The thing is, these past few weeks/months she's been getting into some drama surrounding her supposedly ""leading guys on"" to liking her despite her having a boyfriend (not me) but this isn't true.

I don't really know what to do to even attempt to amend my relationship with her, but all I know is she is basically the most important person in my life outside of family.

POST: I've never dated anyone before so naturally I have a lot of insecurities so call me out if I'm saying nonsense.

I've been dating a girl for the past 2 months which in my mind has surprisingly gone well, but I have yet to breach the question of what we actually are and what she thinks of me. I feel like I need to ask soon before I let myself actually fall to hard for this girl.

Some of my concerns are that she broke up with her EX in January and I'm kind of nervous to see if she's still attached and don't know how to comfortably breach the question. 

Additionally I've had to make all of the plans and always initiate texting, which sometimes takes her hours to respond to, and coming from an awkward guy this always gets me second guessing. Although this is true she does consistently agree to go out, but as insecure as I am I feel like she feels bad for me or something.

So, here's my issue: My girlfriend is still friends with her ex (they dated for 8 years) and they are in the same social circle. Whenever there is an outing, her ex is typically present. 

I have no issues whatsoever with my girlfriends ex, but I believe she does with me. She will not greet me or make eye contact. She basically pretends I don't exist and is normal around everyone else. 

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route. 

This is a pretty uncomfortable situation and I'm hopng for some mature tactics to change the situation for the better.

So I just straight up asked him if he likes me he said yes
but just feels like he has no interest or too busy to be interested in me. We didn't even kiss yet cause he won't do anything if I don't.

I kissed on the cheek like last week

POST: Hello again /r/askreddit.

Story:

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

So I was wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, being mean sure doesn't sound like a good way of changing this.

POST: My boyfriend thinks that it's all a part of the experience of traveling, casual sex does not mean love, and hooking up with other girls does not have anything to do with his love for me.

I understand this at a conceptual level, but I'm still uncomfortably jealous knowing that it will happen. He's also going on a trip for one month and still wants to be in a relationship with me. We've been together for almost 9 months now.

A part of me wonders if I'm being irrational and should just try to be mentally strong and confident. But then again-- what kind of freak of a person thinks it's okay to cheat on/hurt someone he loves under ANY circumstance?

So I talked to my girlfriend about it. She understood blah blah that worked out. The problem is: I don't feel any better. I feel so strange about our relationship now because of things she's said to me. I think I want to break it off. Check my post history if you want to see some of our problems. 

It's just weird now because she acts so happy. Once again is talking about the future. Booked something for our next anniversary (next February). And misses me on the days I stay home - I finally got the alone time I've been asking for. I'm not sure how to approach this.

So...my fin aid is currently cancelled for college and I went through an appeal.

I ask bc my husband has been telling me for years he thinks I'm very attractive and co-workers/friends ""always"" ask how he got someone out of his league. While I think most of this is inflated, I have recently gotten quite a few compliments of new style changes, and I'm left wondering what's so wrong with feeling attractive?! Are we so insecure as a society that we can't just let someone else feel attractive, or is it a perceived fear that other's think less of you when in reality no one gives a damn what you think of yourself.

TITLE: Need some advice on breaking up
POST: So I think it's time for my GF and I to call it quits. A little back story first.

I'm 26, she's 23. We've been together for about 9 months but we've been friends for about 2 years prior to dating. We've had our problems from the outset of dating, most of which we worked out. I've recently been thinking that she probably isn't ""the one"" and I actually tried to break it off last Friday. Instead of breaking up, we ended up talking about everything for a few hours and I thought I had made a mistake.

I should have gone with my gut and stuck to my guns.

Now I don't know what to do, I realize that no matter what I do, I'll be a bigger asshole in the end and I'm willing to accept this, but I just don't know how to break it to her again? I'm worried that if I do it face to face again, the same thing might happen, but not doing it in person seems very impersonal and cold. 

Does anyone have some suggestions?

I personally have a Ceton InfiniTV 4 card in my computer with 2 Switched Digital Video Tuning Adapters that provides for 4 HD streams at a time.  That along with a 2 TB Hard Drive makes for a pretty decent queue of recorded television shows for my fiance and I to watch when we feel like it.

Today I sat down on the couch and after flipping through the recorded TV queue decided I didn't really want to watch any of those things, so I hit the ""Guide"" button on my remote to see what was on.  It dawned on me that this was the first time in at least 2 months that I had watched live television, when I tried to skip forward past a commercial and realized that I couldn't lol.

Well apparently I did a very good job of writing a convincing email back and not giving up. I effectively sold myself in the email and later on the phone so they gave me the last available slot they had for an interview.

My question is, with no sales experience outside of probably selling my car, how can I land this job? I'm nervous as to what kind of questions they'll ask and how I can not sound like a huge buffoon when I have to reiterate to the supervisor that I have no professional sales experience.

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?
