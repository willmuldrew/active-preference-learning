TITLE: My (22f) fiancé (24) has been searching his ex-fiancé on Facebook a lot.
POST: Hey guys

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?

POST: Sorry in advance if this doesn't belong here, but this is my first post.

So today, I told my best friend of a couple years that I loved her. The thing is, these past few weeks/months she's been getting into some drama surrounding her supposedly ""leading guys on"" to liking her despite her having a boyfriend (not me) but this isn't true. Well the thing is the bad rep from the drama has sort of negatively affected her and since I told her today that I loved her she thinks shes lead me on and I think i've severed my relationship with her.

I don't really know what to do to even attempt to amend my relationship with her, but all I know is she is basically the most important person in my life outside of family.

Mom and I got into a heated argument about college. She claimed she didn't have the money to have me and my 3 sisters in college at the same time. My mom makes good money, she's a surgeon and my dad's a well respected and busy lawyer. I got really heated & careless and said that I didn't ask to be born and maybe she should've been more responsible with birth control. She then said that she and my dad only got married because of me and I'm the reason for her failed marriage.

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?

Also, the sound system is crap, and i would prefer the upgraded model with the better system.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

TITLE: Looking for advice on how I [16M] could get my crush/friend/prom date [17F] to actually like me/want to date me.
POST: So I've liked this girl for quite some time (~1 year) and only recently decided to do anything about it. I got her number, we started talking/texting a lot, and finally, since the timing worked out, I decided to ask her to prom. She says yes, everything is going well, and we even decide to go out on a date (at least, I would call it a date) before the dance, and after that she even suggests we do it again if there's time. 

Yesterday I decided to propose the idea of dating after prom. She tells me that she isn't really interested in me like that, likes me as a friend, yadda, yadda, yadda, you know the story. The ""friendzone"" as it is not-so-affectionately named. 

Any advice on what I should do from here? The dance is coming up on Friday, so any advice relevant to that would be great, but I'd appreciate general advice as well.

Dunno about anyone else, but despite my obstacles, I think I have it pretty great when compared to all the generations that came before.

POST: Hello again guys, quick question.

Background: Went out and had some drinks came back home, missed a step outside and fell ~5 steps landing on my knee (concrete). When I awoke the next day I did the best I could with what I had (beach house) to clean the injury.

That was 4 days ago, my scrape is healing pretty quickly, already about 30% smaller from the original wound, BUT since Day 1 I've been having this white-yellow discharge from the scrape. It produces at an accelerated rate when I shower, I try to place a paper towel over it and press lightly to lift some of it off. From what I gathered, it's not smelly, which means it's not infected. It is a little red around the outside, but I figured I'd check in with you guys to double check.

She can leave mid conversation without telling me she has to, it was okay at first now she does this every time.

POST: After reading some other threads on this subreddit I feel like our problem isn't so serious, but I would love some tips/advice nevertheless.

I've known this girl for over 6 years and has been one of my two best friends since 4 years or so. Since two months we're in a relationship. We know eachothers ins and outs, know everthing we did/do, spoken of everthing happened in our lives etc etc. The problem is, we don't have much to say to eachother anymore and running a bit out of things to do together.

Recently we've watched all 4 seasons of Game of Thrones and now we're kinda figuring out what to do when we are together. A couple of days ago we agreed to go for a walk every evening. Something we both enjoy. But it doesn't fill a whole evening, let alone a whole day. Does /r/relationships have any tips/advice on how to give some new life to our relation?

POST: My girlfriend of over 3 years was found out to be messaging her ex, mostly while dunk, and still ending conversations with ""love you"". She maintains that because they're now good friends that she means it in a ""brotherly love"" type of way. When I discovered this was going on, I also found that she had been messaging, quite flirtacously, a guy from her work. These messages included all the ""😍😍"" type of emojis as well has her messaging him in the early hours of the morning asking what he was doing. When I confronted her about this she lied and said it was one of her brother's friends whom she hadn't seen in a while. 

After a long argument I asked her, what would you do if I had done this to you? Her answer was that she would end it with me. However I haven't ended it with her yet this plays on my mind.

POST: Hello,

So, basically i need some advice. After leaving High School (2 years ago) i decided to get a job working for a food chain company (first ever job). Worked their for 3 months or so and decided to leave and go to University however, while leaving i didn't have the most positive experience.

Now, finishing the first semester of uni, i found out that my Overseas trip (planned before starting uni and said to be OK by the Uni) would in fact not be OK and that No matter what i could do, my week long trip would result in failing of all papers that semester. (Uni refunded costs of semester after much debate)

So, its now been 7 months since i have been working or studying. I decided a month ago, i wouldn't return to Uni This Semester (just over it and needed a break). I currently owe about 12000 in student loan and 3000 or so to my parents who lent me some money and i need some advice.

POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

He has bad teeth, is overweight and has some other physical issues (acne etc.). He is however a wonderful, sweet person with a very giving personality. He is gay, which means he is having to navigate dating in the very shallow world of Grindr male hookups and so forth. He barely ever gets any attention. I see him being passed over time and time again by guys who think he's a great friend but just can't see him in a romantic way.

I don't want to ask about how to solve this problem - obviously there's not any quick fix for this - but what would you do to help support and cheer up my friend after yet another rejection?

I'll Keep this short.

Years (YEARS) ago, in college, I was suspended for one semester, because of cheating. I was young, stupid, and STUPID. Happened once, and I reformed my ways.

OK now fast forward. Been married for about 5 years. We both respect each other immensely. I've never lied about my past to my wife, but I've never bothered telling her about my past transgression.

Anyway, lately, for some unknown reason, I've been thinking more and more to those years ago. I feel like I need to get this past history of mine OFF my chest to my wife. But I also know that it might be putting her through stress with no real reason (after all, whats the point of telling her? so I can feel better, at her expense?)

He could come out here for Christmas. I have 3 young kids he doesn't get to see that much.  He'd get to watch them open presents. We'd go skiing. I've already taken the week off of work. It would be perfect!  And fun!

I have not yet graduated from my school, but I haven't been enrolled for ~15 months. I will remain a student until I independently finish this one last requirement and get cleared for graduation.

My mom may need to move soon, and she'll need to get a mortgage on a new house. She's also the cosigner on my (private) student loans, totaling ~$123k. With that debt hanging over her, she and her wife can't get a mortgage.

Consolidating my loans is something I've been intending to do regardless. I want to do it to get the loans out of her name, but despite a decent salary ($60k), my debt-to-income ratio and credit score are too high to qualify independently for just about any options.

I am a 17 year old male in high school, and I've run into some problems.
I used to be pretty fit and slim back as a freshman (150ish, 5'10''), but as i have stopped sports to pursue music, lacked a healthy diet, and has put some weight back on (170-180, 5'11''). All of the fat goes to my lower stomach, and you can start to tell on my face.

I am a super busy person with music, student government, and other extra curricular activities, so eating healthy is a huge problem for me, and I am a HUGE snack person. I have never been able to lift a whole lot either. I was a cross country person for a while, and I can still run fairly well, it's just having the motivational to do it.

What should I do, and where should I start?

POST: Original Post: 

Thanks for all the comments and thoughts.

I told her on Monday that we needed to break up. She was surprised at first and understandably upset. I told her that we were just becoming two different people and that it would be better to end the relationship on a high note before we start to resent each other. 

She still wants to be friends, which I understand. I don't know if it will work out, but I told her that after a while of no contact we can reach out and see if we're ready to establish some kind of platonic relationship.

So I'm sad and newly-single. I've been going out drinking with a good buddy from work, and that has made me feel better. 

I still can't help thinking about her, but I hope that she'll be happy. I hope we both will be. :)

And now on to the question. My bike says in my last cycle I burned 350 calories in 90 mins ( I know I cycle slowly. It's kinda in the background as I play or watch videos. It's usually about 10 - 13 mph).

Here we go: I work as a dental hygienist (30F). I had a (33M) patient last week that I felt I really clicked with conversationally. I was too chicken to pursue it at that moment. We live in the same building and discovered that we have a mutual friend. 

Should I just wait it out and hope to run into him, or take action, like sending him a message on Facebook? Keep in mind, I really am trying to keep the creep level to a minimum.

POST: So I am in college and got my first ever girlfriend; I have hooked up with people before, also just in college, but never had a relationship.  

The weird part is I was so sure I wanted a relationship, but since we started dating suddenly I am not so sure.  I feel myself almost wanting other girls even more badly now (sort of a want-what-you-can't-have type of thing).  

I'm not sure if this is a normal reaction to a first relationship or maybe I thought I was more ready and mature then I actually am.  Any thoughts?

(We haven't had sex or done anything past 2nd base so could it be sexual frustration?)

TITLE: Negotating pay rise/better conditions in current job - how to do it, what tips?
POST: Hi Reddit,

I work 30 hours a week, for which I'm paid at around the going rate.

I have a job on the side, which I'm allowed to do when I take holiday from my work.

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I'd appreciate tips on strategy about how to achieve this… and am sure that the kind and wise folk on self.jobs can help me in my goal!

TITLE: I just put-in my 2 weeks notice. Why does this feel like an uncomfortable break-up?
POST: As the title says, I just put-in my 2 weeks notice at work. My bosses seemed shocked and saddened. 
The strange thing is that they tend to be rather ruthless and fire people with little to no warning, for reasons that are questionably truthful.
However, instead of jumping for joy, I feel saddened and a little depressed. I even thought about taking back my notice of resignation because of how saddened they seemed.
The closest feeling I can think of that's similar is when I break-up with some who is obviously not a good fit for me. Which is usually followed by doubts about whether or not I should get back with my ex.
Is this a normal thing when ending a 'professional relationship?'

POST: I know this sounds extremely shallow of me but I can't get over it. All I've known him with for our relationship is having a beard. Not a super big one or anything but it's always been there. 

He shaved it all off today for a job, and he looks like he's 16. He's just simply not very attractive without it. I hate how it looks. And it's not like he can just grow it back, because this job doesn't allow facial hair so he can't grow it back until he gets a new job and that might be a very long time.

He has more than one ulcer and now some if not all of them ruptured, and then he started to bleed out of almost every orifice and to make matters worse, the ambulance in my shit-hole of a country decided that they weren't going to send anyone. It took my neighbour's fire-fighter friend to get them to send one.

In that time, he had turned yellow, lost any semblance of control over his bowels and slipped in and out of consciousness, when he was awake he was delirious. This is after 2 hours of waiting. Now I am worried, my mother is with him and I'm at home ""holding the fort"".

Learned the hard way that's not the case.

No one ever talks about ""crank arm length"" -- the length of the arms that the pedals are connected to. And the length is pretty damn important.

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

In the car were several, clearly drunk, guys and they start talking to us claiming we trashed their neighborhood.

In less than a month, I'm turning eighteen.

I've always been that person that never celebrated his own birthday. This is because I didn't really have any friends until I got out of middle school and because I always thought my parents were embarassing.

I do have some friends now, and I've been invited to several 18th birthday parties myself. However, I still do not  really want to celebrate my birthday. The house I'm living in is a mess and I wouldn't even know what to do or prepare for such a party. 

The real problem is that people ask me what I'm gonna do for my birthday etc. Whenever I tell someone that I haven't planned anything, they look overly surprised and I don't know what else to say. What am I supposed to do? Is the 18th birthday really a ""must-celebrate"" and will people be mad at me if I won't do it?

POST: My fiance is a full foot taller than me (I'm 5'4"" and he's 6'4"") and I hate the idea of being that short compared to him on our wedding day. I wear heels quite often and want to on the day we get married but, like any reasonable human, don't want to be completely uncomfortable. I can usually wear 4-6 inch heels for a few hours and 2-4 inch heels all day, but I'm hoping to find some 4-6 inch heels for the big day so we can be closer in height (plus it gives an incredible slimming effect when in high heels and a long dress). 

I'm willing to compromise and find super tall heels for the ceremony and switch to slightly lower more comfortable ones for the reception, but obviously they can't be too big of a difference in height because the dress will be too long. I've been looking at [these] on amazon (in gold) but don't have any other ideas.

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I overheard her say something halfway into the relationship, over the phone. Something you don't say to a friend. I don't think he cheated though.

I was snooping on his computer, something he would possibly break up with me over. I found that he had said he met this ""awesome girl"" around the time he met her. This has left me upset and I feel betrayed. It was a post he made on here over two years ago, before I met him. But still. He lied to me.

He knows that this is an issue because my ex cheated with a girl he liked before he met me.

I don't know how to ask him about it. We are about to move and I refuse to move if he won't admit that he lied

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again.

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

We are an open couple, my female friends join our bed occasionally on the weekend, or after few glasses of wine my wife like to watch me getting a blowjob. But Anal sex is off the table. 

She even offered I will look someplace else for anal sex, she just won't do it. 
I don't bring this issue up anymore for quite sometime, but I am very much into anal. I don't fuck around(unless my wife is watching). I want bought strap on so she I will try my ass and I will try hers.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

TITLE: Delayed petty revenge, fifty years to be exact.
POST: When I was a student in the 1960s, I had a teacher which we will call Mrs Jackass. Mrs Jackass was the reason I never saw bright light in my school years ever. She was shouting at me always for no reason e.g dropping a pencil onto the floor during a test. But this was the last straw that broke the camels back. One day, I had a bleeding nose and went to get a tissue. She hit me with the cane for bleeding in class and I never got that tissue. Now I'm a waitress in a restaurant and Mrs Jackass steps in to order some Steak with Chips. I took down her order and went on to get this really old and musty steak. I asked the cook to cook it and he did. She was about eighty and recognised me after a few minutes. She gives me ""the stare"" as I hand over her food. Long story short, she left her plate half eaten and gave a big tip. Best delayed revenge ever.

She wants to finance a new car and wants me to cosign because I have decent credit. I told her no because based on her inability to pay bills on time and actually save any money, consigning would be a very bad financial investment for me. She keeps nagging me to cosign, almost like she won't take no for an answer. I also figured (didn't say this to her) that if we break up in the future I wouldn't want my name/SSN/credit to be linked back to her. Am I wrong for not wanting to cosign?

This girl I met has been hitting on me for a while and I'm interested. However, today she said something that really bothered me.

POST: We are on amicable terms but I have not shared much of my life experience with them for a long time. This is because I did many things in life that they have disapproved of, and after many uncomfortable talks during which harsh words were exchanged and I was chased out of the house (but subsequently returned), I decided not to share any of those experiences with them again.

POST: Hey, so its been two years, she met new guys, I met new women. When we see each other we talk casually about work, how we've been and so on. We didnt remain friends, which is totally fine by me, but still we care. A couple of weeks ago, we met at a business event, she mentioned that she had a lots of stress at work, up to the point where she got sick at the beginning of the year. We also talked about a mutual friend who got seriously ill.

My question is, is it ok to text her to ask her how shes doing now? If everything turned out fine? 

Whats you opinion?

The problem is, I suspect that she is thinking I never got over her, and I dont want to make that impression. I still care, but not like that.

TITLE: Can I take HMRC to court for being late processing my return?

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

POST: My neighbor is an older woman and she hasn't been in the best of health in the past couple of years. She's gained weight that she wants to lose, but when I brought up talking about her diet she brushed me off. A few days later she told me she got prescription appetite suppressants from the doctor. 

This makes me feel concerned, but should I push her to try to look at her diet and see if there are changes she can make before she tries the diet pills or should I just leave it alone and whatever happens, happens?

And if I do say something, what could I say to convince her that diet pills are not the way to go?

TITLE: Me [17M] concerned about age gap with a potential girlfriend
POST: I am an exchange student in a foreign country this year, and in the next few days i will be going out with a girl that i met recently.
My concern is the age difference and wonder what you guys think about it. I am 17 and will be turning 18 in 2 months, she is 16 and her birthday isnt until november. 

So i am 1.5 years older than her and it makes me a bit unsure, even though when i met her i assumed she was 17/18 based on her looks.

I recently read a post about some girl (15) that was going out with a guy that was like 24. I know that is totally different but just reading the stuff about how the family was very concerned etc puts me off. Because there *would* be a period of a few months where i am 18 and she is 16, and i worry about the connotations of that and what her family etc would think.

Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

She did have a very ugly chrome Nissan license plate on the front of the car. Barely pushed the plate back to where I could have fixed it by hand... The lady stormed out of her house all mad and asked how much money I had on me at the time...and said ""I guess i won't call the insurance).

But while we were chillen at her house, she brings up some fb messages I see a message from a guy and jokingly give her a hard time about it. She said you can read it so she opens it and scrolls up real fast. This makes me think shes hiding something so as I scroll down she makes a comment to this guy via message saying ""why did you cut your hot ass hair"". Follow by him responding with a frown face she then replies. ""Whats the face for babe?"" Idk but from what I figured the name babe was a term solely used for your SO. needless to say we had a talk as I was a bit pissed at her talking like this to another guy, she used to have a crush on.

POST: I thought the wheel size was the only measurement that mattered.

Learned the hard way that's not the case.

No one ever talks about ""crank arm length"" -- the length of the arms that the pedals are connected to. And the length is pretty damn important. They are generally measured in millimeters, and the 170mm crank arms that came on my kid's 20"" bike are as long as those on my adult bike. (Apparently this is a thing on BMX bikes, this bike wasn't clearly billed as such)

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

Trying to find replacements, but these aren't parts generally designed to be replaced on cheap bikes. So now it's one of those situations where attempting to save money is probably going to cost more money.

I've been maxing out my 401k contributions and am purchasing stocks through our share matching plan as well.

I was walking to school one morning when I was about 15 when I heard a voice call out ""Hello? Excuse me? Young man?"". I turned and saw a frail old man who must have been in his 90s standing in the doorway of his house. I walked over and he asked if I could help him with something. I said I would help, so I followed him to a step-ladder in his kitchen. He said that he needed to change the bulb but he couldn't get up the ladder. 

After I changed the bulb, he said that he'd give me something for helping out. He reached for a small tray of change on his kitchen table and picked out the only 50p coin in his tray of 1p and 2p coins. I told him he didn't have to give me anything but he said that it was only right to reward helping out an old man.

POST: We dated for most of high school. Made it through our first year of college, but she found someone else. She still talked to me after that. She hooked up with my a bunch over that summer and never told him, which I felt bad for. She finally told him and he blamed me, not her. They're still together. She now says its my fault. I feel like I've been betrayed. Hard. I never had this problem, and I feel like a sucker for having to resort to reddit for help.

POST: Dating for about a month - things seem positive. We live far apart so we are seeing each other about once a week - usually for 4-5 hour dates. If it matters, we've kissed, but haven't slept together yet.

We have plans to go skiing for the New Year for a few days (we spoke about it and booked lodging) so I have to assume she must be interested since we will be spending a few days together alone.

However, I get a little worried at times because she never texts first, or initiates a hangout. I've gone 3-4 days without texting first, and I won't hear a thing from her. 

Is this something to be worried about? Is she thinking about me at all?  I know some people aren't big ""texters"" but still, you'd think she'd reach out every once and a while, right?

After a very short while it does go away (usually about a city block or two). It feel like mainly the tendon that sits on the kneecap in the front and runs to shin (Patellar Tendon), feels like its tight.

My question is, is this ok or normal? I don't feel overly concerned but then again I've never received proper or professional training tips so for all i know its a big issue. Any advice if its abnormal or dangerous?

POST: Me: 19. Her: 18. Both of us are college freshman and we've known each other since the beginning of last semester. We hang out most days in a group of five (4 girls including her and myself).

Over the past few months I've been picking up on a few things that lead me to believe that she likes me, and I fear it may be reaching a critical point at which it will need to be confronted. The most recent signs have been things that mutual friends have said (most telling is ""You know she loves you"").

Thing is, I see her as a friend only, with no romantic attractions at all. So what I'm looking for is a way to let her down softly when the time comes without having to jeopardize our friendship.

So about a month ago i was cast out (dumped) from my first true relationship after a life of near misses and what not. It lasted six months and i felt that my sheepishness had a lot to do with it. So i made a point to not be mopey and use that loss as incentive to change myself for the better. I am working out more and actively making new friends and things like that but this is not about moving on. 
My real question is how do i meet more people, and of course meet more gals. I do not drink (ever) so bars are not much help (nor are they really my scene) and all i really have is my work at a barnes and noble and home. Trying ok cupid which but not much going on there, i am average looking i guess (if you want to know what i look like, look at my post history)

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

I have been friends with this girl for a while now asking her and things were going great until I asked her to prom.

I really like the girl but i'm wondering if she saw too much into the prom-posal. Should I just give up, or ask her out? Im not sure

After all the advice I got from you all and my attorneys office I emailed the ex to state that I would require public visits until we have an independent supervisor in place mutually or appointed by the court. 

I sent the first email Thursday night, with a follow up this morning, and just made a call to her mobile which ended in voicemail. 

If she fails to respond what should I do?

Her expectation is that the visit tomorrow will be at her house. But obviously I am uncomfortable with that considering she called the police on me at my own home for a ""perceived"" threat which the police apparently found baseless since they didn't make a report and left.

POST: **Background:**

I am a programmer from the DC area.  My wife is going to start grad school next Fall, so we will be packing up and moving to LA at the end of this summer (August/September... about 6 months from now).

**Problem:**

I'm afraid that my inability to start the job until the end of this coming Summer will disqualify me from most jobs currently available.  I know a lot of companies hire college grads way in advance, but I don't know if companies will hire people this far in advance if they are already in the industry.

**Question:**

Do I apply for jobs now or wait (if so, how long)?  On one hand, I want to start applying now so I can have a job secured before I get out there.  On the other hand, I don't want to disqualify myself by applying to positions too soon.

I really need advice on this...

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

So here is the deal, it was an on/off again relationship for about 4 years. Had some shit go down neither of us were able to deal with like adults. Ended it about 2 years ago, haven't said a word to each other in at least a year and a half. Not a word not a FB hello nothing, zero, zilch, nada. 

A week ago the e-mail saying ""hi, how are you."" Leads to the exchanging of phone numbers etc. After having a couple of conversations with her I realize I want no part of being with her. 

However I do still enjoy her company. What I need from you all is to tell me how exactly you would go about putting a EX-SO in the friend zone.

One day,  though,  I was getting out of the shower and became extremely confused, which really scared me so I stopped the medication. 

That was all before I started school.  Since this semester began I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety.   For a while I was handling that, until my grades started to fall.  After that I became unmotivated, lethargic,  and irritable.  

Now I'm debating going back on the meds because I've not been able to ""kick"" the depression.   My concern is that I might experience more of the side effects.  If I've already experience a few, does that mean I'll experience the others?

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone. When I first got him, about a week ago, I was taking him out every 2-3 hours but could rarely get him to goto the bathroom. Instead, he just comes inside walks around my apartment for 10 minutes and then goes. I've tried every hour on the hour as well. It's been a week now and he's consistently doing this no matter how long we take him out for. We went on a nice long walk yesterday (thanks to warm weather) and he barely sniffed the ground. But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times. What am I doing wrong? Any tips are appreciated!

Now we've been friends for the past couple of months and we have the same first period class together, with alot of our  mutual friends. We have quite a bit in common with things like music, food, style and fashion.

She's one of those people that you'd do anything for, who's smile brightens up your morning.

Here's my problem. Everytime I try to talk to her (in person even though she gave me her phone number) or try to get her alone so I can really tell her how I feel, I choke up, get distracted (I have ADHD) and make thing painfully awkward and pushing her away from me sending me closer to the 'Friendzone'.

I told her I was joking ( I can cook but have limited knowledge.) but it was just so...direct and rude. She replied a little cold after that and I just ignored her...

So, here's my issue: My girlfriend is still friends with her ex (they dated for 8 years) and they are in the same social circle. Whenever there is an outing, her ex is typically present. 

I have no issues whatsoever with my girlfriends ex, but I believe she does with me. She will not greet me or make eye contact. She basically pretends I don't exist and is normal around everyone else. 

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route. 

This is a pretty uncomfortable situation and I'm hopng for some mature tactics to change the situation for the better.

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

POST: I've been dating this girl for about 5 months. We meet almost every day, call/message all the time - we really like each other. I'll be going abroad in a years time to do a 17 month course - I'll be back home twice or thrice a year. 

She says she doesn't want to be in a long distance relationship. So, I guess, if I leave we're going to break up - even though I don't want to.

My question is - What's the probability that her opinion will change if we go out for another year? Should I just break it off now and find someone who wants to be with me no matter what the situation before we both get more hurt?

My mom thinks that all the booze is gone, but I know he still has some ( called the local taxi company to pick him up some vodka ). Last  night, he wouldn't take his meds, and drank instead. 

I'm not sure if I should tell my mom about this, it is quite a common thing when she isn't here. The only thing that is making me not tell her is that he is 72, it is his life. He is well aware he is ill, and knows drinking isn't a good combo with his meds.

POST: Throwaway account. Here's the details. They're quite juicy. 

I was in a nightclub the other night and a random girl came up to me and started making out with me (wait a second, I'm not as lucky as you think). I was such in shock I didn't do anything. It lasted for about 5-8 seconds and stopped when she told me she needed a smoke outside and left me. Today (48 hours later), I've felt the worst pain urinating I've ever had in my entire life. All we did was make out, is it possible that I can have urinary pain from HSV-1 or is that urinary pain just from something else?

POST: After reading ""The Giver"" in 6th grade, it's always stuck with me. Once or twice a year I'll give this book a read. The ending has always struck me as powerful, because you're left with a kid who's run off and at this point has no one, dying in the snow. In his dying moments he hears music in front of him, and maybe behind him, as a sign of his ultimate sacrifice in order to bring color to the world. I've always seen it as a strong, poetic ending and I think it's shaped much of my philosophy in life. For reference sake I'm now 27.

Spoiler alert. Then I had to go and read books two and three and find out that the kid from The Giver's not dead at all. He went and became leader of another dystopian future-town (that I guess has been inundated with the horrors of capitalism through the Trade Mart?)

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: Hi reddit,

I recent came across a blog post by a local Northern Irish writer, [""Rape Culture: The Stuff Lads Mags are made of""] It's not the best written thing in the world, but it asked a lot of (what I thought) were interesting questions on a piece of research that showed approximately 50% of the public responding to a survey, couldn't tell the difference between 'lads' mags quotes, and *quotes from convicted rapists*.

I don't really subscribe to the ideology of 'Rape Culture', but this recent study does make me wonder about it. So I wanted to ask;

POST: I'm a college student, and about a month ago I entered into a long-distance relationship (and my first relationship in general) with a girl I met on Facebook a year ago. (I realize that that in itself is strange, but things are going quite well so far, so I'm not worried about it). 

I wound up applying to intern on a sustainable farm this summer, and got accepted. When I got the acceptance email, however, I discovered that my girlfriend's ex (who goes to the same school as I do) will also be interning there.

So basically, I'm going to be stuck all summer at a tiny farm with my girlfriend's ex. There are a total of four interns there, so I can't really avoid her. The thing is, she doesn't know that my gf and I are together. Should I tell her beforehand, and if so, how? Or am I better off just keeping things a secret?

I received it as a gift from the UK after I had already bought the standard edition from the EA Store, so all I could do with it (until now) was to use the Collector's Edition DLC unlock code on my main copy of the game. That means the Collector Armor and Collector Assault Rifle won't be a part of my offer, which includes codes for the game itself and Cerberus Network access. The code can be redeemed through EA Download Manager, which you can get from the EA Store itself free of charge.

I want to trade the two codes for a Steam copy of either Darksiders or Alpha Protocol. PM me if you're interested. I'll respond within an hour or so.

POST: Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks.

I've been officially dating my girlfriend for almost three months. Before this we were hooking up for about a month before we put a title on it. I've dated before, but never have had a relationship as serious as this. This is my first ""serious"" relationship, and i'm not trying to rush anything. This girl just continues to blow my mind. She just bought a plane ticket to come to a wedding I invited her to that several states away. I know most of her extended family, I know her weaknesses and her aspirations, and she knows mine. I'm sure I have feelings for her. I guess what I'm wondering is whether it's normal for the male (given today;s societal roles) to say the three big words first, or if I should hold off and wait until she says them first.

The desire to save money has fueled my research to find a different solution, and recently I stumbled on this article: 

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I'd appreciate tips on strategy about how to achieve this… and am sure that the kind and wise folk on self.jobs can help me in my goal!

TITLE: Ex contacting dilemma
POST: I (23/f) left my first love (same age) when I was 19. It was long distance, we were both co-dependent and not trusting of each other. I think in the end we were both smothering each other. But i broke it off two years in. First kiss, first sex first everything. I never gave him closure.

Fast forward and I have been in a wonderful relationship for almost two years. I couldn't be happier. The problem is, and I know this sounds strange, but I keep having dreams (that do not correspond to any feelings in my normal life) in which I meet and have conversations and make amends with my first love - maybe like 3 times a week for the past couple months.

Do I ignore these dreams? With knowing that a ""fuck off"" or no response might occur should I reach out to my ex On positive terms? Not for a fuck, or a mind fuck or anything similar. Just to make amends. Or am I crazy?

TITLE: Advice/Suggestions on best cat collars?
POST: I bought a collar when I adopted Lola at the beginning of July, and she's probably worn it for a total of one day since then. Any time I put it on her, I come around and find a collarless kitty wandering around 5 minutes later.

I'm not sure if it's because the collar itself is too easily removable, or if it's because I'm not putting it on tight enough(?)...

She's indoors so it hasn't been a huge deal, but I'm moving to an apartment within a house this weekend, and because she's a ""door dasher"", I'm a little concerned she'll make a run for the yard. In the past when she's run out the door it's only been down an apartment building hallway - nowhere for her to run. But with the move, there are many places to go :(

Oh, and she IS microchipped, but I want the collar as a back-up so that people will know immediately that she belongs to someone and isn't just a stray.

POST: Reddit, I am currently planning a trip to Moscow for a small vacation this August. I have already acquired my plane ticket and necessary documents but yet to have reserved a hotel as they are expensive and don't seem anywhere near as nice as what you could get in the US for that price (cheapest hotel is about $100 a night).

My friend suggested I use couchsurfing.com and see if anyone would host me for the few days while I'm over there. The site seems legit and makes it seem like this community really cares about having fun and meeting new people.

However, I would really like to not be kidnapped. I can not stress enough how much I would love to wake up with my money and passport intact each morning, as well as my necessary organs. Can you guys offer me any advice?

POST: This person is my step dad (of 6 months)'s first cousin, so I guess that would make him my step half cousin? It's such a distant relationship that I don't think it matters that much, but I still feel weird about it, considering the fact that he has the same last name as my step dad. We have met a few times and gotten along great, but I didn't think of it as more than that until this happened. I think he's cool and everything and would probably consider opportunity if I didn't consider him *part of the family*.  BUT then again, we are nowhere near blood related, not even distantly, so?

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: I broke up with my girlfriend in July because I was going to university and I would be moving out of the city and it would be difficult to be with each other. She had wanted to move in with me, but I had refused.

I thought I would get over her, but that has been unsuccessful. Before I actually moved out, I called her. She had another boyfriend already. I was crushed.

Fast forward three weeks, we are talking now, texting every day and Skyping rather frequently. She says she wants to break up with her boyfriend, and that she misses me. However, she still does not seem interested in getting back together.

Is there any hope for me? We are talking a lot now, and I really do love her, and it's killing me that she is hesitant to be with me again, despite how she always says how happy she was with me.

What do I do? Just play the waiting game?

This upset me...a lot. I know we're not exclusive and we're just dating right now. Am I wrong to feel bad? Is she wrong for going on another date with someone? She knows how I feel. She feels the same. She doesn't want to jump into anything serious so soon. She says she wants things to happen on their own and not force them so early. 

I've been out of the dating game for a long time and I really like this girl. I don't know what to think anymore.

TITLE: Is this a good way to talk with a girl for the first time? [M19] [G?] *UPDATES*
POST: Original Post: 

So, I took the comments into consideration. I decided that I would follow what they said, and try small talking with the girl I like instead of formally approaching her.

So, I missed school yesterday and missed some work. I decided that I might as well use this. So today, I went up to her during some down time and said, ""Hey ___. I was wondering if I could take a look at your notes?"" Something standard along those lines.

She said yes, as I sat next to her. I copied the notes and in my stupidity I didn't say anything. I rushed to copy them, and it took about 2 minutes. I hand that papers back and say, ""Thank you ___. I'll see you around.""

I know I should have said something more. Now that I have atleast spoken to her, what should I have done so I know for next time?

POST: I know a lot of folks hate the little guy, but the other day I was listening to a song he did with Kany West, a remix to Runaway Love. It was pretty interesting, and it got me thinking, what if this kids the next MJ? 

In all do honesty, his current music isn't what we're all fans of, but keep in mind, he's young. He can't sing about dramatic life experiences, breakups, or heart ache, because he hasn't experienced that yet.

So what does Reddit think, could Justin Beiber, potentially be the next Michael Jackson?

 I have a college diploma as a power engineering technician and have applied to the only job related to my field in my area. It's a very prestigious job. Lots of money. Could work there for life. My issue is that 250-300 people are being interviewed for the same position. There will be approx 60 positions. 

I don't know if my interview was good enough. My current job is minimum wage fast food. I may end up not finding out I didnt get hired untill august. 

My other option is the navy. The Canadian military is in need of maritime engineers and that fits my diploma. Nothing is keeping me in my area accept the possibility of this other job.

I could wait 6 months to find out I have been waiting on a refusal, and becoming an engineer in the navy could give me experience I could come back with.

POST: I want to start with the fact that I do love my girlfriend. We have so much in common and she truly makes me happy. But I find myself thinking about sleeping with other women more and more often. We don't have sex too often because she doesn't feel comfortable in her body.

Shes not fat by any stretch of the word. But I think me being in better shape than her makes her uncomfortable during sex. So we have sex once every few weeks. I don't want to cheat, I never have, but I can feel the urges getting stronger and I don't know what to do.

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched. I'm still making progress with frenulum stretches but it is pretty slow.

My question for this subreddit is: How far do I need to be able to retract the foreskin to safely have sex? After doing some cursory research it seems like it only needs to be able to pass over the glans. But wouldn't that only allow for ~ an inch of penetration?

TITLE: Can I take HMRC to court for being late processing my return?
POST: It seems completely unreasonable to me that if I pay my VAT bill 12 hours late, I am fined almost 100% of the figure for doing so, yet I have just got my tax bill from 2009/10 (it was 40p!), nearly a year late and somehow it's OK for HMRC to just write a limp apology letter.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

POST: There are so many things I can't say without him yelling for no reason. I want him to talk to me like he did before...
He pays for my life, I have no family to go to, no friends that weren't his first.
I used to have dreams about what I wanted to do in life but they were never good enough for him and he'd yell at me for aiming low. 
It sounds like an emotionally abusive relationship but how can that be if my real emotions left me years ago. I grew up with an emotionally and physically abusive family and my father thinks he can still tell me what to do and guilt trip me from thousands of miles away. 
I don't have the courage to stick up for myself or the means to take care of myself but I feel the last bit of possible happiness being sucked out of my soul.

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends.

POST: Hey, guys.  I've had my phone now for over five years and while it has more than stood the test of time, I think it's time to move on.  I'm looking for a phone that is 3G, or whatever G is the most current nowadays and probably a touch-screen of some sort.

I'd like to stay away from buying an iPhone as I feel the second I get one, it will quickly be replaced by the newest version that comes with a slightly larger headphone jack or some bullshit, rendering mine useless.

I use AT&T and will not be switching providers, so please use this information in your advice.  Price is of no concern, so use your imagination.  Not your literal imagination, though, because it is very hard for AT&T to bill me on that.

I've come to reddit because, I can honestly say, this section of the internet has genuinely won me over for being so intelligent and insightful.  I love you.

POST: Hey guys

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?

POST: So earlier this month I opened a CFNA credit card with STS to pay for a repair I had done on my car. I went ahead to pay off the debt once I got the money. Online payment for CFNA requires the bank account and routing numbers. For days after I submitted the payment I was wondering why my account balance wasn't changing. When I went to check my CFNA account I found that the payment did go through but it was not from my account. I had messed up the account number and it appears I may have taken money from someone else.

TITLE: 18M Need advice on asking a girl out, or maybe even if I should
POST: So there's a girl (I'm in high school) I've been talking to for a while who's pretty unique. Usually I can get a decent read on a person's character and personality, but not with her. She just seems to operate differently and it makes me a little bit self conscious about things I would normally consider automatic signals of interest. She snapchats me, messages, or texts me on a daily basis, and she went to prom with me but we never asserted whether it was as friends or not, she hasn't ""friendzoned"" me yet, and so I've decided just to ask her out. I was wondering if you could give me advice on the situation? What's a good first date idea that is casual enough to have no pressure but cute enough to be obviously a date? Is it possible she thinks nothing of the amount of time we spend talking?

POST: I'm a 20 year old female and I get that this is only normal considering my age but I can't handle myself anymore. I have never had sex and don't plan on it right now due to body issues etc. I masturbate everyday and sometimes more than once. I stopped watching porn because its unfulfilling and instead sext/phone sex with a guy friend of mine. I've been regularly going to the gym. Eating mostly healthy and sleeping the right amount. But regardless of all this, I feel horny almost all the time, especially with this guy friend. I've come to the point where I feel I need sex and having had a bad experience before and where I am with my self image right now, I can't get myself to participate in sexual intercourse. Please let me know of any ways I can help lower my libido. Thank you

The evening went well and we hit it off, chatted for close to 10 hours while cuddling in her bed. We have been texting for the last few days, and I am pretty sure she is interested in me. Here's the thing though, I am not really attracted to her. I would love to just be friends with her, but I think I might have already started on the wrong leg. The best part? I will be working in the same office with her every day for the next 4 years.

TITLE: Does my friend have LEG CANCER?!
POST: My friend and I were about to go get some food at 11 PM when he was resting his legs on my own. I was resting my hand on his leg and felt a weird bump below his kneecap. Upon lifting his pants-leg (which was totally fucking gay) and looking at it, closer inspection revealed that it was a mass of bone.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.

So.... Anyone want to tell him that mass of bone isn't normal / tell us what it is? I'm aware of the Kneecap and the smaller kneecap-like bone behind it that helps facilitate movement, but this is below his kneecap, IE his leg doesn't run smoothly down, it has a jagged ridge of bone below his kneecap for a few inches before evening out.

Any ideas what it is?

TITLE: Charles Schwab vs Vangaurd Target Retirement
POST: Long story short - I recently started investing into a Roth IRA account. To be specific a Target Retirement Fund that will mature over time as I grow closer to retirement age. Due to a recommendation from a coworker, I opened up the account through Charles Schwab and have already transferred an invested $3,000 into the Target Fund. 

However, I've since learned that Vanguard has an identical account as the one I chose through Schwab, and the fee's are less and the YTD returns are more. Here are the number differences:

*Charles Schwab 2055 (SWORX) Net Expense Ration 0.73% / YTD Earnings 2.97%
 

*Vanguard 2055 (VFFVX) Fees & Expenses 0.18% / YTD Earnings 6.95%

Last month when I flew back home to India for a holiday, my doctor there replenished my medication stock for me. But he gave me a 6 month supply of Escitalopram (Lexapro) instead of Citalopram.

Today I finished my previous stock of Citalopram. Unfortunately, my doctor here near my flat is on holiday, tomorrow is All Souls Day which is a holiday too. The next appointment I can get is probably next week. Is it okay to switch to Lexapro? I mean, I have no other choice as of now.

POST: We meet at a camp during the summer. She wouldn't talk, look or even walk toward people because that's how bad of an introvert she was. Being an ex introvert I decided that I would try and help her come out of her shell.

I then realized that I really do have feelings for her like I actually liked her. I asked her out and she said yes. We have been together for a month now.

The problem started toward the 3 week mark of our relationship. She always says that other girls are so much prettier then her and she doesn't know why I'm with her and not these other girls because they're so much better then her.

What do I do to help her feel her self worth?

POST: I have been told so many different things by people who are NOT car salesman and i was hoping reddit could clear things up for me.

Last month I leased a new 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe.  

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?  The car i just leased is a 4 cyl engine...Now, after having driven it around town, i really wish i had gone for the V6, as everyone says the gas mileage really isn't that much different, and the power IS.  Also, the sound system is crap, and i would prefer the upgraded model with the better system.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

Story:

I was talking with two friends, one male and one female, about our love lives. They both are in relationships, the male just got with one girl, while the female has been dating this guy for a year and a couple months. Point is, they (sort of) know what they are talking about.

When I told them who I like, they said that I make it really obvious that I like them, and that she thinks I am ""too nice"" to have her say something about it. And that I do this with every girl that I like, which had me thinking.

So I was wondering, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, being mean sure doesn't sound like a good way of changing this.

My partner claims this is all innocent and simply a means of escape, I however feel deeply hurt.  My partner feels betrayed as well because a mutual friend sent me the screen shots of the aforementioned evidence. This I agree was a violation on their part of his trust.

TITLE: Me [25 M] with my GF [22 F] for 5 months, There's going to be long distance between us in the future, which she doesn't want, but I do.
POST: I've been dating this girl for about 5 months. We meet almost every day, call/message all the time - we really like each other. I'll be going abroad in a years time to do a 17 month course - I'll be back home twice or thrice a year. 

She says she doesn't want to be in a long distance relationship. So, I guess, if I leave we're going to break up - even though I don't want to.

My question is - What's the probability that her opinion will change if we go out for another year? Should I just break it off now and find someone who wants to be with me no matter what the situation before we both get more hurt?

I paid him with a cashiers check (Supposedly as good as cash) and he went to the bank to pay off the loan. That is where the trouble started. Fifth Third said that since he was not paying off in cash they could not sign off on the title until Tuesday, which was the next business day. That's fine no big deal. So I go back to the bank today (Wednesday) to have them sign off on the loan and now they are saying it's a two week wait.

POST: Aside from the standard stuff I've seen around here, like drinking water or filling up on really dense/low calorie food, I've realized a method that works for me to avoid feeling hunger pangs.

I noticed that during the week, when I'm watching TV or browsing reddit, I tend to get hungrier more often. I just want to eat when I know I shouldn't. But on the weekends I eat less than I usually do and don't seem to get hungry. I still browse the internet and watch TV probably a similar amount, but it's when I have free time and when I also do something else: play videogames.

Something about focusing or getting entirely absorbed in a good game somehow gets me through a whole day, almost forgetting to eat. I've experienced the same thing when reading or writing something, anything that gets me to focus all of my attention on it.

POST: I love her and this is not, **repeat not**, a deal-breaker but I'd like her to be more feminine. She grew up basically feral, has no female relatives any less feral, and is too embarrassed to talk to her friends.
Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

POST: Back story:

So I've been going to school with this girl for the past two years now and we're graduating from college on Thursday. She broke up with her boyfriend back in December and ever since then we've been really close. We would hang out a lot and I even tried using some tricks to see if she's into me, like picking lint off of her shirt and she would do the same for me sometimes. Those kinds of things. We'd cuddle in her room and stuff, but we got into a big argument about a month ago and we've slowly been building our relationship back up. And even when I fuck up with her, she still lets me back in her life (I haven't fucked up since then.) I'm pretty sure she knows I like her, but should I just tell her in person that I do? Or is it too late? Just to get it off my chest. If she doesn't feel the same way, I still want to preserve our friendship. Anyway, should I?

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off?

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

POST: Alright so, this Sunday, I have the opportunity to go check out my potential second dog (Border Collie, working lines). I've never encountered puppies younger than 8 weeks, and I am kind of hoping to ""gel"" with one above the others to make my final decision easier. But! I have read that the ideal time to test these things is at 49 days. Any younger and it *could* change my judgement.

Have any of you had an experience with picking out your pup at 4 weeks, when visiting the litter? Was their behavior and likes/dislikes consistent with what you ended up getting at 8 weeks? I'm not paying attention to looks at all - the only thing I want is a pup who enjoys toys, play, and has a lot of potential drive to tap in to. Ace, my current dog, is aloof and independent, and I have had to overcome a lot of obstacles to get to his current state of biddability!

POST: I've been talking to this girl since the beginning of this year but just the past 3 months we've been seeing each other every single night. She's not the best at expressing herself emotionally like if I tease by saying I'm gonna leave or walk ahead she'll grab my arm and say ""no..""

My question is if we're actually dating or in a relationship even though she's not comfortable talking about it or setting rules in a direct way.

TITLE: My [20 M] gf [19 F] broke up with me for someone else in my friend group.
POST: So we broke up a few weeks ago and now she is dating someone else in my friend group. I don't know what to do. My friend group is very close and my brain is telling me to cut them both out of my life for all the pain they have caused me and because I can't take these constant reminders and seeing them together. 

However, cutting them out isn't such a simple task. Like I said my friend group is very close and I'm afraid it will tear a hole in our friend group if I delete them from my life. If everyone is hanging out and they're there, I don't think I could muster up the strength to go. I'm lost and afraid. Life is never fair is it?

Time will hopefully heal this, but right now I'm devastated and a mess.

What should I do?

POST: So after a good first date I asked her out again a week later, just over to mine, watch a film, pretty relaxed and casual compared to the first date, she said yes and sounded enthusiastic.  

I text her that day to see if she was still on for watching a film later at my place. She said yes and would give me a txt before she called over.  

A couple of hours pass and then I get a little paragraph of a txt to the effect of - She'd been in a terrible mood all day. She felt she wouldn't be good company for the night, that it was for my own good and that she'll have to rain check. I simply replied 'No problem' and left it at that.  

I feel her reason for cancelling is pretty valid and I haven't questioned it. But my question is, where do I go from here?  Do I contact her and try rearrange or do I just leave it and wait for her to make contact with me?

I just recently got a job and decided that I should finally get around to cutting my hair, now I don't have extremely long hair, but for a guy it's pretty long, about down to my shoulders. 

I've always been told I've nice hair, thick, dark and well-kept and I was wondering if there was a place similar to ""Locks of Love"" that I could donate my hair to? 

Now I would donate it to Locks of Love, but my predicament is that I'd like to get it cut at a barber so it at least looks groomed instead of just chopped off, and what I'm asking is if there is a place that I can bag my hair and send it to via mail or even just dropping it off in the central Texas area that will accept it with open arms?

So, basically i need some advice. After leaving High School (2 years ago) i decided to get a job working for a food chain company (first ever job). Worked their for 3 months or so and decided to leave and go to University however, while leaving i didn't have the most positive experience.

Now, finishing the first semester of uni, i found out that my Overseas trip (planned before starting uni and said to be OK by the Uni) would in fact not be OK and that No matter what i could do, my week long trip would result in failing of all papers that semester. (Uni refunded costs of semester after much debate)

So, its now been 7 months since i have been working or studying. I decided a month ago, i wouldn't return to Uni This Semester (just over it and needed a break). I currently owe about 12000 in student loan and 3000 or so to my parents who lent me some money and i need some advice.

POST: Hi guys,

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

What should I do now?

POST: 2016 is the year of diversifying my reading life. What does this mean? Great question, I don't really know. At the end of last year I realized that I had read a lot of books (112 to be exact) but there wasn't much variety going on, I almost exclusively read history and literary fiction. I decided that was bonkers, and that I needed to expand my horizons. 

As part of this, I picked up Outlander by Diana Gabaldon as a romance pick and I thought it was AMAZING. I realized that I didn't want to talk about it to the group of friends that I usually talk to about books, because I was kind of embarrassed to have loved a ""romance"" book so much (about 2 days later I got over it and talked their ears off about it).

I have a question regarding state taxes, and I cant seem to get a definite answer.

As a college graduate of June 2015, I searched and interviewed for multiple positions before accepting a position in New York state this past February. However, part of the hiring process is a 6-9 month temp period which I'm currently 4 months in to. The temp agency I was referred to is in northern New Jersey, which is where I also live.

My question is: Do I pay both New Jersey and New York taxes, or just New Jersey? I've asked the other temps in my group as well as the temp agency itself and still do not have a definite answer.

I am currently only paying New York state taxes and this doesn't seem right.

POST: I'll keep this short and sweet.

My ex of 3 years and I split up a while ago, and during the time apart I've never not thought about him or not missed him, even after I moved on and entered a new relationship. I'm happy with my current boyfriend, but a large part of me wants to get back with my ex (he very much wants us to have another chance, but not immediately; he wants us to keep focusing on improving ourselves and get back together when the time is 'right').

I'm not sure if I should 'give up' on that relationship and move on. I'm not sure if I even can.

POST: I was about 4.  We had a HUGE white dresser (probably just a normal one, but in my memory it was HUGE).  And I put all my clothes in the top 2 drawers.  That way, I had empty space at my level in which I could play games, or hide things, or whatever.  Also, I used to climb on top of the dresser a lot and heavy drawers were hard to pull out to make steps to get on top of the dresser.  This created an unstable equilibrium which I was not aware of at that time.  Well, I was playing near my dresser one day, and bumped into it and it came toppling over on top of me.  It ended up falling half onto the bed, so it didnt squish me.  But I was terrified.  And that was my first lesson on ""center of gravity.""

POST: I recently decided to be more thorough about losing weight. I was losing weight at a nice speed about a year ago, roughly 1lb a week. Then we had a baby and got all the weight back.

It's usually about 10 - 13 mph).

POST: Here's the scenario:  I've found myself in a new position in an office job.  Being the new guy I've found that I have very little to talk to people about.  Enter the terrible small talk.  I like to take things that other people say and use them inappropriately or in the wrong context.  For example, I heard ""At least it's not Monday!"" on a Tuesday probably 10 times yesterday.  I like to take that phrase and say it on a Friday.  Or also saying ""At least it's not Friday!"" on a Monday.  I can't explain it, but this makes me incredibly happy.

I have various categories ranging from the day of the week, time of the day, weather, upcoming holidays, etc.  I have about 70 entries right now, but I know there is so much more awful small talk out there that I'm missing out on.

POST: Hey r/loseit,
I am a 17 year old male in high school, and I've run into some problems.
I used to be pretty fit and slim back as a freshman (150ish, 5'10''), but as i have stopped sports to pursue music, lacked a healthy diet, and has put some weight back on (170-180, 5'11''). All of the fat goes to my lower stomach, and you can start to tell on my face.

I am a super busy person with music, student government, and other extra curricular activities, so eating healthy is a huge problem for me, and I am a HUGE snack person. I have never been able to lift a whole lot either. I was a cross country person for a while, and I can still run fairly well, it's just having the motivational to do it.

What should I do, and where should I start?

TITLE: Getting kicked out by roommate.
POST: I've been living with my ""friend"" since January 1st in Yuba City, CA. I moved in with this friend with him knowing I was going to be unemployed (I quit my job to move with him) and he was fine with that as long as I did chores until finding a job. Well, it's been four months and still no luck finding a job. He told me at the beginning of this month I had to find a place to stay on May 1st or go to school so I signed up for school this summer and he still went back on his word. I've been calling around to several places trying to get advice but seem to be getting the runaround.

My question is can he just kick me out on a whim or do I have any rights to have a 30/60/90 day notice?
