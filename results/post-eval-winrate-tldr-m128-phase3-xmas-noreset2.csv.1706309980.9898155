TITLE: Hoping my LD boyfriend [26M] will grow into being more affectionate towards me [18F], after six months, what can I do to get a little more attention?
POST: My boyfriend is absolutely amazing at everything that he does. He's a wonderful person and I can confidently say he's my best friend. Roughly three months ago, he moved about 1k miles away (work related). We talk daily (even if it's brief, one of us manages to call) and I've visited once. Gradually (pre-move) he became less focused on me and more so on the move. I couldn't expect anything less. Lately, it seems like environmental factors have been influencing him more frequently (forgets to call me back, fewer intimate conversations, ect.). He's easily distracted, and generally a reserved person. What can I do to help him open up to me without being overbearing?

POST: I (23/f) left my first love (same age) when I was 19. It was long distance, we were both co-dependent and not trusting of each other. I think in the end we were both smothering each other. But i broke it off two years in. First kiss, first sex first everything. I never gave him closure.

Fast forward and I have been in a wonderful relationship for almost two years. I couldn't be happier. The problem is, and I know this sounds strange, but I keep having dreams (that do not correspond to any feelings in my normal life) in which I meet and have conversations and make amends with my first love - maybe like 3 times a week for the past couple months.

When I was in college attending a hockey game, I walked by the 50/50 raffle booth. I had always thought of entering, but as a poor college student a dollar was worth more at McDonalds than the odds were of winning. 

However, this time as I walked by I thought, what the hell, and dropped in two dollars. This was around Christmas time, so I was pretty poor. 

During the hockey game they announced the winner, and I ended up being the lucky draw.

I won somewhere around 160$.

It was enough to buy a few Christmast presents that I wasn't able to afford prior to winning.

Because of the size of the stations and going from bus to subway or subway to train, there is quite a distance to walk and I want to cover it quickly.

Now, I'm fairly tall compared to most people in this country and hence I walk with a large stride. I also walk quite quickly (much to my wife's annoyance haha).

But what irks me to the upmost is when these little people with their short legs cut me off and walk slowly in front of me, especially when talking loudly (they are like macaws here) to their friends or on the phone.

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route.

POST: We are both high school seniors who will be going to college in a year. The college I am going to is about 3 1/2 hours away from the one she will be attending. She has been my only serious girlfriend up to this point, and she wants to stay together through college and then move in together. Every time I'm with her, I have so much fun. She is so great, but in the back of my mind I want to have experiences with different girls. Not sure what to do/think. I know if I break up with her, she may be gone forever, and I know that I'm really in love with this girl.

POST: She got out of a 2 years relationship and about 1.5 months later, we started to date. She told her parents and they didn't let her date me because they think that she doesn't know what she's doing. She said she didn't care and still kept dating. Yesterday, she told me she was under a lot of stress because her parents call her everyday because people tell them we are still dating and stuff and wants to have the talk. 
Also, we started having problems a few days back. It's really weird because her ex (who lives next door), just came back from vacations and even though she said they talked and agreed to be just friends, I saw on Snapchats that he became one of her ""best friends"" and apparently send a lot of pictures.

POST: Be sure to explain in detail with line breaks.
Hey, so i've been with my gf for quite sometime now. We live a bit far from each other so WE do not get to meet each day(sometimes  we don't meet for a whole week). Anyways so we mostly talk over Facebook/Viber Voice chat ect.. 

So whenever I'm talking to her, she's always my priority,  I'd only focus on talking to her when she's online. But I'm sure it's not the case for her. She can leave mid conversation without telling me she has to, it was okay at first now she does this every time. I talked to her about it and she just told me that she has things to do sometimes and they were all poor reasons, I mean I could leave due to many other reasons but I just don't.. 

Am I being a bit more worried than I'm supposed to?

I know I'm not in a relationship with my ex anymore, but it felt as though I was cheating. I might (don't yell at me for this) be holding on to a tiny bit of hope that me and my ex will get back together eventually.

Is it too soon to be dating? Should I stop seeing this new guy even though he's amazing? I'm most definitely not over my ex yet. Do I have to tell him about this new guy? I really don't want to hurt anybody.

So long story short, I was at a party, got pretty drunk, and I ended up telling this girl that I like basically how much I am attracted to her. so the next day I apologized and told her that I wasn't in my right mind, I was drunk, etc.

Because I don't see her very often (I'm a first year and she's a second year, completely different faculties), a week later she sets me up gloriously to tell her again and I blow chunks out the ass; kinda laughing it off (some might say I'm a shy guy).

Basically, 2 years ago (before I was with gf), this guy impersonated someone my gf was seeing at the time using a texting app and got her to send a nude photo of her.

POST: The long story short is that I want to upgrade my phone but in the long run it will cost me hundreds (perhaps thousands) of dollars to do so because I would have to give up the unlimited data plan I have right now.

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

We hung out a couple of times but after she told me she liked someone else we started to drift apart. A couple weeks ago we started talking again. I asked her out over text and she told me that she was flattered but she had broken up with her bf about 2 weeks ago. She told me she would keep my offer in mind when she was ready to date again. She finished off by saying "" I'm just not into the whole dating thing yet"" I told her I was sorry to hear that and that she should take all the time she needs. So my question is, does she like me, what can I do to show her I really care, and what should I say to her from now on. I'm sure older redditors have good advice they can give me. Thank you! :)

Background:

My dad met a woman and has been dating her for three years. They don't want to get married until all of her kids and me are out of the house. 

Anyway, my understood-step mom has a daughter who over three years who I have become in love with. She is best friend and I have no idea how she would respond if she found out. Another problem is she lives in another city a few hours away but I visit every other weekend. She and I are only 16 and we are also kind of physical. We will stay up until 4:00 in the morning talking with our arms around each other lying 3 inches from each other's faces. We tell each other absolutely everything. (except this of course). I'm not sure if she actually cares about me or she is being a huge cocktease because she does not want to lose her problem solving talking friend. This is the most awkward situation ever.

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia.

So I am 22 years old, and just got my first job out of university (yay!) 

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

I live in Ontario, Canada by the way.

TITLE: Hey reddit, do you think looking at cam-whore girls is wrong if you have a girlfriend?
POST: My girlfriend asked me what I look at when I masturbate. I told her I either click on a few videos on redtube or youporn, or I go to livejasmin or cam4 and watch the cam chat girls. She was ok with watching traditional porn, but when i mentioned that I go to camming websites, she was saddened. I read an askreddit post about communicating with girls on /r/gonewild, and that most people thought this was worse than simply viewing porn, since you can private message the girls on gonewild, and possibly chat with them. The reason I watch cam girls is because the traditional 'porn' look is pretty gross IMO. I find normal/amateur girls more attractive than girls with fake tits and way too much makeup. In any event, I told her (and I plan to stick to this) that I will refrain from visiting camming websites.
What do you guys think?

POST: We've been dating for one month and up until last week, she was very warm towards me. However, the day before I left to help my whole family move into a new city (two days drive each way), she became cold towards me.

While friendly, she isn't flirty, responsive to my flirtations or has been warm towards me at all. My mom thinks it's because I missed an opportunity to meet her family (she mentioned that she wanted me to meet her family on a public holiday that passed while I was away a few weeks ago), is afraid I might leave, or I said something to hurt her. 

Of course she could have cold feet as it's a one month old relationship, but that's just me being negative.

That said, when I returned home, all of her toiletaries were gone from my bathroom. She had been looking after my cat for me while I was away, and it's a bit of a shock for me.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

TITLE: Can I train for a marathon with cross-training twice a week?
POST: I'm considering doing a marathon in April, but I'm wondering whether I can continue doing capoeira twice a week while I train. Here's my deal: Mondays and Fridays I do capoeira, and Sundays and every other Friday I do the hash (tamer European version though, so I can get away with just one post-run beer). I'm wondering whether only 4 runs a week (assuming I take a real rest day), one of which is the hash, could be enough for marathon training. That would give me one hash, one long run, and just two normal runs per week. That wouldn't even be 30mi at first.

My current level: standard run is a 10k at around 52:00 (fastest is a 48:00), longest run I've ever done is a half marathon (not in a race, just ran 13.1 mi on my own). So I'm an ok runner, but I still haven't crossed over into being truly serious about it.

My bank (HSBC) took 4 weeks to produce one as initially they were only giving statements and were not producing the reference in the form the landlord wanted. They finally produced it this week and my landlord said i can move in on the weekend. However, he says that as it has taken 4 weeks, he wants me to share the cost of the rent for the past 4 weeks before I move in. Is this okay to do? He had not passed over they keys or allowed me to move in until the bank had produced the reference, which was held up on no fault of my own. He is refusing to allow me to pay rent from just my moving in day. Can I get some advice on whether he is being fair or if there is something I can do?! Thanks! (I live in the UK if that is relevant at all)

TITLE: This is about my brother. What should my parents/family do?
POST: I'm his 18 year old sister (living at home). He is 23 and has many issues and my parents have no idea how to help him. He failed out of college his freshman year and is addicted to oxycodone and uses cocaine and many similar drugs. He can't afford to live anywhere and keeps losing part time jobs, etc. He surrounds himself by the worst possible people to get better. He goes through phases where he tries to get help and my parents will do whatever they can but it keeps costing them a ton of money (therapy that he stopped going to--paying off his car payments, etc). He's been arrested a few times-all drug related and just ended up in the hospital for stomach pains (from drug use). He is currently living at home and any advice on dealing with people who do this would be so helpful. Thank you.

I've already brushed indirectly about the subject, asking if she'd want to stay where she is. She said she definitely would want to leave her country, but again, I feel like I'd feel better if I got to know that she's willing to do it because she thinks is right rather than do it because I asked her out of love.

POST: Signed up a few weeks ago. This is my first post. 

I (F23) attended a university for 4 years, yet never graduated. Mental, emotional, and physical stress towards the end of my senior year caused me to not return to classes. I never officially withdrew from the university, just never signed up for next semester. I proceeded to pretend I was a university graduate, but without a piece of paper to back me up.

We have been striving for the best quality in our videos but our Latinamerican audience don't really seem to be responding as fast. 

So, I guess my first question is *Does joining a Network actually help jumpstart your channel into having more views and reaching a wider audience?*

TITLE: Charles Schwab vs Vangaurd Target Retirement
POST: Long story short - I recently started investing into a Roth IRA account. To be specific a Target Retirement Fund that will mature over time as I grow closer to retirement age. Due to a recommendation from a coworker, I opened up the account through Charles Schwab and have already transferred an invested $3,000 into the Target Fund. 

However, I've since learned that Vanguard has an identical account as the one I chose through Schwab, and the fee's are less and the YTD returns are more. Here are the number differences:

*Charles Schwab 2055 (SWORX) Net Expense Ration 0.73% / YTD Earnings 2.97%
 

*Vanguard 2055 (VFFVX) Fees & Expenses 0.18% / YTD Earnings 6.95%  

My question is - how easy is it to switch from one fund to the other, and is it even worth the hassle?

TITLE: Counting Calories and Exercising?
POST: Hello all.

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off? For example, I know most males aren't supposed to eat fewer than 1500 calories a day, and when I do (or did, should I say) the weight loss just isn't as prominent (not to mention that at below this point, the body's chemicals start to unbalance).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

TITLE: How do I handle this?
POST: I (23m) and my ex-gf (20f) of almost 2 years broke up about a month ago. She had a really hard time with it at the time but has slowly been recovering. I miss her and I feel like we might be able to fix the issues we were facing.

Last night I was having a really hard time imagining what I would do without her and I texted her for the first time since the breakup and asked her to meet up this weekend to talk to which she agreed. 

So now I'm torn because on one hand I really want her back, I still love her. On the other hand, I'm afraid that maybe it still won't work and I'd end up putting her through the pain of the breakup again, which makes me sick thinking about. 

Does anyone have any similar experience or advice to help me out? I'm really lost.

TITLE: I [20/M] have a girlfriend [20/F] but I kind of fell in love with a new girl [17/F]
POST: Hey! Here is my story: I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend 4,5 years now. Last week I've met a girl (that also has a boyfriend), she talked to me at a party. I have not met here since then, but I will meet her tomorrow at another party. It is the final party of her exchange programm. Yep, she is an exchange student and will leave in 2 days...

But I kind of fell in love. I always think about her. Sometimes we are talking on facebook and she even said that I'm cute. (Don't know if that's much...)

Since I have a girlfriend for such a long time, I'm not really into these flirty things anymore tbh. What should I do, /r/relationships? **Tell her that I fell in love?** **Or is it better to not say anything?** I'm confused because I never thought I would meet someone that attracts me more than my girlfriend.

TITLE: Boyfriend (20m) shaved his beard and I'm (19f) having trouble being attracted to him?
POST: I know this sounds extremely shallow of me but I can't get over it. All I've known him with for our relationship is having a beard. Not a super big one or anything but it's always been there. 

He shaved it all off today for a job, and he looks like he's 16. He's just simply not very attractive without it. I hate how it looks. And it's not like he can just grow it back, because this job doesn't allow facial hair so he can't grow it back until he gets a new job and that might be a very long time. 

Has anyone else had this experience? I love him and I'll continue to but I don't always want to not find him attractive. If anyone has any advice, it would help. And to those who are just going to call me a shallow prick, please, don't. I'm sure you've had moments like these where a change in your SO's appearance has disappointed you.

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone. When I first got him, about a week ago, I was taking him out every 2-3 hours but could rarely get him to goto the bathroom. Instead, he just comes inside walks around my apartment for 10 minutes and then goes. I've tried every hour on the hour as well. It's been a week now and he's consistently doing this no matter how long we take him out for. We went on a nice long walk yesterday (thanks to warm weather) and he barely sniffed the ground. But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times. What am I doing wrong? Any tips are appreciated!

Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

I just got a job and have to work 5 days a week, from 7:30- 11. I didn't choose this schedule, its the only time that fits with my classes.

Meanwhile, Ive started to see this other girl, and were exclusive (Met her around the same time but recently started putting more effort into it). We enjoy each others company and do a lot of similar activities and my friends really like her.

6 Months have gone by and she clearly states among friends she isn't dating him. They do however definitely have a thing or a FWB situation. Anyway when we hangout together she kind of still is all over me, whether it be cuddling with me or holding my hand.

I've told her I liked her in the past but nothing really came from it. 

Basically overall I am not sure if I should remain friends with her or go for anything. I would just like some advice because I don't know what to do.

POST: So the title is a bit misleading... He's not my boyfriend, but its more serious than just FWB.  We've been together since last May, but took a 2 month break last summer (due to long distance) so we've been together for 9-11 months. Anyway, he seems to have recently lost his sex drive. We haven't had sex in about a month and I don't know what to do. Even when I try making out with him he either doesn't seem into it or participates for a bit and then just wants to sit there with me holding him. I have a very high sex drive, and I'm getting increasingly frustrated that my only release is masturbation (which is happening sometimes twice a day at this point, because it provides some release but doesn't really leave me fulfilled).

POST: I live in a townhouse, and my neighbor has a unloved puppy they just keep on their deck 24/7, never cleaning up the poop, and never getting walked, and I've never seen anything resembling care that a puppy should receive other than providing it with a bowl of food/water. 
It smells really really bad. I can smell the poop from my upper bedroom if my window is open. Being outside on my deck is unbearable with all the flies feasting on the poop and it smells like a petting zoo. 
I don't think they are fit to own this puppy, and my heart breaks for this dog, who looks incredibly sad and lonely and just lays around in detached loneliness.
I'm not a dog person. I've never owned a dog. I don't know if they are breaking any dog laws in the state of VA.
Any help suggestions?

TITLE: Me [28 F] with my girlfriend[40 F] 4 months, issue with her ex.
POST: Hi Everyone,

So, here's my issue: My girlfriend is still friends with her ex (they dated for 8 years) and they are in the same social circle. Whenever there is an outing, her ex is typically present. 

I have no issues whatsoever with my girlfriends ex, but I believe she does with me. She will not greet me or make eye contact. She basically pretends I don't exist and is normal around everyone else. 

We've never had a conversation because she won't acknowledge my existence. I have tried to bring this up with my girlfriend, but she ends up making excuses or defending her ex, so I can't go that route. 

This is a pretty uncomfortable situation and I'm hopng for some mature tactics to change the situation for the better. 

Thank you in advance!

TITLE: Me (24F) with newish semiserious BF (26M) is it bad to go on a copy cat date?
POST: BACKGROUND

Okay, so I was in a relationship for 7 years (15-22) with someone. While we dated I put in all the effort, arranged fun dates and tried really hard to be the best gf I could be. He put in no effort and arranged no fun dates. I dated around with a few guys between 22-24, nothing longer than a few dates each. Now I'm with someone who I'm pretty serious about, dating 8 months now.

 In my first relationship I made it a pretty annual thing that we would go on an adventure tour. The only years we skipped were years I asked him to book the tour and he forgot until it was too late and they were sold out for the year. (it only runs June-August). This was something I wanted to do since I was 13 but wasn't old enough until 16.

No one ever talks about ""crank arm length"" -- the length of the arms that the pedals are connected to. And the length is pretty damn important.

The result is that when his feet just about each the pedals at the lowest position, his knees are practically in his chest. As an inexperienced rider this throws him way off balance.

TITLE: A Job/Ethics Dilemma
POST: So I was recently passed over for a promotion at my company by someone who is extremely under-qualified compared to my work, seniority, and educational background. Upset and feeling like it was time to move on anyway, I wanted to give my notice and quit. My mother suggested though that the best way to ""stick it to them"" is to take a leave of absence then go on disability for a couple months (I have a legitimate disability that is exasperated by my job). This would allow me to be paid for a couple months while not working and look for my next job. I've always felt social benefits are for people who are really in need (my ""disability"" is fairly manageable and more of a nuisance than anything else), and I don't know if it is right to ""milk the system"" in the name of making my employer suffer. I'm in a bit of a moral quandary. Help?

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

TITLE: Cold? Too bad, I'm in charge of the thermostat from now on.
POST: I work at a dr's office in a building with other tenants.  We have three thermostats.  One of our exam rooms gets particularly cold, it happens to also be the room we do pap smears in.  Whenever my coworker, Maria, notices she has a pap (we don't do them often) she turns the thermostat to 78*.  We are in south Texas, it's hot and humid.  78* makes the entire nurses station and 4 other exam rooms hot and gross.  The building maintenance came in on Friday to check our air flow, they were getting a complaint that one of the offices (newly leased) was too hot.  Turns out that our back thermostat also controls that office.  I told Maria that maintenance said not to touch the thermostat.  I get to keep it at 70-72* without the whole back office getting hot.

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?

POST: Well, not really an accident per say (minimum damage)(not even to care itself). I backed up maybe 9 inches and barely touched this lady's car outside my house. No damage done to the car at all. She did have a very ugly chrome Nissan license plate on the front of the car. Barely pushed the plate back to where I could have fixed it by hand... The lady stormed out of her house all mad and asked how much money I had on me at the time...and said ""I guess i won't call the insurance). I looked up the license plate on the Nissan web site and it is 50 DOLLARS! I really don't want to pay for that piece of shit. What should I do reddit??

TITLE: Didn't punch a guy back
POST: So the other night, I was chilling in the car with a couple of my friends on a street a block away from my house. We were just talking when this car pulls up next to us. 

In the car were several, clearly drunk, guys and they start talking to us claiming we trashed their neighborhood. Obviously we're just like wtf and we're trying to talk to the guy when his friend from behind him gets out of the car and confronts me. Then as we're talking, he just sucker punches me. Now, I have a pretty short temper and have gotten into fights before but for some reason, it didn't really make me mad (maybe because the punch wasn't really much?). 

I actually smirked and we just said fuck it and we left. My friends asked why I didn't do anything and I really didn't know. Now I can't tell if I really don't care or if I'm just a pussy. What is it? Am I just being a bitch or am I ""maturing""?

POST: My boyfriend is absolutely amazing at everything that he does. He's a wonderful person and I can confidently say he's my best friend. Roughly three months ago, he moved about 1k miles away (work related). We talk daily (even if it's brief, one of us manages to call) and I've visited once. Gradually (pre-move) he became less focused on me and more so on the move. I couldn't expect anything less.

TITLE: Want to win a past flame back, does the ""epic declaration of love"" speech work in real life?
POST: Set up: I'm sick in love with a girl I dated a few years ago. We never really broke up, I graduated and moved, she began traveling for a few months. It just sort of stopped, with no hard feelings. Now we're in the same city, both unattached, and see each other often, in social settings.

The problem is, I can never seem to get her alone anymore, and don't really feel any interest from her at all. She's always been hard to read, and we never really spoke about how we ended, so my thought is I just need to lay my feelings bare in an ""epic declaration of love speech"" in one of the few times I can talk one-on-one.

TITLE: Advice/Suggestions on best cat collars?
POST: I bought a collar when I adopted Lola at the beginning of July, and she's probably worn it for a total of one day since then. Any time I put it on her, I come around and find a collarless kitty wandering around 5 minutes later.

I'm not sure if it's because the collar itself is too easily removable, or if it's because I'm not putting it on tight enough(?)...

She's indoors so it hasn't been a huge deal, but I'm moving to an apartment within a house this weekend, and because she's a ""door dasher"", I'm a little concerned she'll make a run for the yard. In the past when she's run out the door it's only been down an apartment building hallway - nowhere for her to run. But with the move, there are many places to go :(

Oh, and she IS microchipped, but I want the collar as a back-up so that people will know immediately that she belongs to someone and isn't just a stray.

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia.
