TITLE: Me 19[M] confessed to 17[F] and she likes me back but
POST: So I recently confessed my feelings to a close friend of mine and she reciprocated. I felt great. A few days later she tells me that she isn't ready for a relationship and she wants to scope things out and see where she stands, probably because she just finished high school, I completely understand.

I was told that there is a possibility of dating, but not right now. So I backed off for a bit and gave her some space and now she's inviting me to hangout, watch movies together etc. I'm confused on what to do because I'm getting mixed signals, I asked her again and she says she's not ready yet and doesn't want to hurt me but every time we meet up together we get closer. 

I'm just confused on what to next, keep pursuing or just take a step back and when she's ready?

TITLE: Me [22F] with my boyfriend [24M] been dating for 2 months,he's way too busy and timid about dating
POST: Been seeing him for two months we were friends before for a year. 
I was the one to ask him out and for two months it was always me that asked to go anywhere or I would tag along where he's going. I always have to hold his hands or else it wouldn't happen or message him first.

So I just straight up asked him if he likes me he said yes
but just feels like he has no interest or too busy to be interested in me. We didn't even kiss yet cause he won't do anything if I don't.

I kissed on the cheek like last week

I don't have much experience either, only dated one guy before him so I'm so lost. I like him a lot so should I just be patient and wait for him to get time off from work?

We are going to go through marriage counseling weekly at least.  During that period, we are entertaining her moving out to a nearby apartment while I stay in the home.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

TITLE: What are the pros/cons/potential pitfalls of adopting a data-only VoIP smartphone plan?
POST: The long story short is that I want to upgrade my phone but in the long run it will cost me hundreds (perhaps thousands) of dollars to do so because I would have to give up the unlimited data plan I have right now. The desire to save money has fueled my research to find a different solution, and recently I stumbled on this article: 

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

TITLE: Dear Reddit, are there any car salesman/dealers out there?
POST: I have been told so many different things by people who are NOT car salesman and i was hoping reddit could clear things up for me.

Last month I leased a new 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe.  

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?  The car i just leased is a 4 cyl engine...Now, after having driven it around town, i really wish i had gone for the V6, as everyone says the gas mileage really isn't that much different, and the power IS.  Also, the sound system is crap, and i would prefer the upgraded model with the better system.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

POST: So, back in August a friend of mine asked me out on the terms that at some point we were going to break up. Mainly because neither of us were looking for a serious relationship and wanted something temporary to at the least have a little company now and then. Lately I have been feeling like the charm of this relationship is wearing off and I would like to part ways as ""lovers"". However, I am unsure as how to broach the subject with out it coming off as shitty.

  The complicated part is that my ex whom I dated for 5 years brought up the subject of working things out. ( He and I remained very close friends though out the 2 year since our breakup. And yes, the current knows about him and our history...) While I am hesitant to make any plans with my ex, I don't want this to come off as I am specifically leaving my current for my ex.

Me and my girlfriend have a 1 year old female Cairn terrier. She knows basic obedience commands (sit, stay, come, heel, etc.) and does these commands pretty well when we are inside our apartment.

The problem comes when we take her outside to go to the bathroom or to take a walk. There are plenty of people / animals around our apartment and she gets crazy excited when she sees anyone. If there is no one outside she does decently well, but still isn't very responsive to our commands. 

We've tried taking her favorite toys and her favorite treats, but she still is not interested in them. The only way we can get her to get a little bit of focus on us is to completely leave the situation with her.

TITLE: How do I [25 F] get my boyfriend [27 M] to get a job?
POST: Here's the situation:

I've been dating him for over a year now and recently he has decided to go back to college. However, due to poor financial decisions in the past, he has no money, no job, and doesn't really actively seek a job.

Instead, I'm paying for almost everything for him and it's frustrating because I just got a full time, salaried position, and I can't even enjoy the money I'm making because I have to save money to pay for things like his car payments and gas money. He doesn't have his own place and just crashes at his friend's. The problem is that I'm too nice to cut him off and every time I push him to get a job by reminding him of all the things I'm paying for, he turns it on me and accuses me of ""keeping track"", which I am not.

Have any of you ever been in a similar situation, what is the best way to approach this?

I think to fairly compare them we should only look at the 'normal soldiers.' From what I heard the SS is mostly responsible for carrying out the Holocaust.

POST: Hey guys

So, I(22f) was on my fiancé's (24m) phone because we were at my friends house who he never met and I used his phone to find her through his Facebook and add her for him (his request). We've been together for over a year.

Some background information, he was engaged just last year to some girl he claims he didn't really like but felt pressured to marry, but she cheated on him and he left her.

So I went to type in my friend's name, but his last three searches popped up in the drop down, and his ex-fiance was the first one. So out of curiosity, I opened his activity log and he has searched her over ten times, the month of January 2016, alone. He told me he had blocked her.

I'm not really sure how to feel about it. I know he loves me and we are engaged, but it still makes me insecure. I don't search my exes. 

Is this something I should ignore or bring up?

POST: I have been told so many different things by people who are NOT car salesman and i was hoping reddit could clear things up for me.

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?  The car i just leased is a 4 cyl engine...Now, after having driven it around town, i really wish i had gone for the V6, as everyone says the gas mileage really isn't that much different, and the power IS.  Also, the sound system is crap, and i would prefer the upgraded model with the better system.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

He thinks it's completely normal, I think he has supercancer or something.
