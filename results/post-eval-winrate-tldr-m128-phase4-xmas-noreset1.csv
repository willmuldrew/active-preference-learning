TITLE: I have been a lurker for years. Now I need education advice.
POST: I am a 24 year old Canadian who wants to go back to university. I went for a few years right out of high school, but I didn't find a program that could keep my interest. Now, a few years later and a huge chunk of student loan debt paid back, I want to go back. This time around, I want to go for chemical engineering. I am not the greatest math student, but I am a quick study and I'm determined to get a degree in something I think would be worth it. I was wondering what reddit thinks. I'm not really sure if I should because I'm afraid to fail and afraid of sinking into debt. I hope someone taking the course or someone in the field could share something about their experience with ChE. Sorry if my question isn't clear. (sent from my phone on a work break)

At this point, would it be wrong to go on a first date with another girl?

I don't want to be dishonest, but I also don't want to take myself off the market until I'm confident that the relationship is going somewhere.

I can't really believe they weren't true feelings in the first place because it' not just a matter of weeks, sometimes it can be years. And I don't get over it only by sleeping with the person, sometimes it's just a kiss or a declaration that makes it go away. 

So I'm tired of acting like a bitch, because yeah that's kind of the word that describes acting like you're madly in love and the next day forgetting the person. But really it's not deliberate. I'm really into the person and then intimacy shows up and I can't deal with it. I try not to show it but of course at some point it's obvious.

The most recent signs have been things that mutual friends have said (most telling is ""You know she loves you"").

Thing is, I see her as a friend only, with no romantic attractions at all. So what I'm looking for is a way to let her down softly when the time comes without having to jeopardize our friendship.

POST: Let me start by saying I am a really shy guy.
So long story short, I was at a party, got pretty drunk, and I ended up telling this girl that I like basically how much I am attracted to her. so the next day I apologized and told her that I wasn't in my right mind, I was drunk, etc.

Because I don't see her very often (I'm a first year and she's a second year, completely different faculties), a week later she sets me up gloriously to tell her again and I blow chunks out the ass; kinda laughing it off (some might say I'm a shy guy).

I now want to tell her for serious that I was embarrassed about my actions at the party, but what I said was true and that is how I feel about her. How important is it that I tell her this in person?

She agreed to grab coffee but had to cancel due to being insanely busy with work. I told her to get back to me when her schedule allowed it.

She canceled about 10 days ago and I haven't heard from her since. Is it worth reaching out or should I leave the ball in her court?

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

A lot of people are aware of this happening, including the close friends of the guy who got cheated on, the guy still knows nothing about it. I feel like if I was the one to tell him it would obviously be detrimental to a relationship that's half a decade old, but unfortunately, also to the guy's relationship with all of his friends that chose to keep him in the dark this whole time.

By telling him I feel I'd be causing the guy unnecessary pain... But on the other hand, maybe I'm this guy's only chance to avoid him going down a long dark road which he may choose to avoid given he knows all the facts.

I used to work between 32-40 hours at a hotel with Marriott.  Marriott sold that hotel, and I transferred to another hotel with Marriott as well.

My(20M) gf (20) has never done anything in our relationship that has led me to believe she would do something that could hurt me but these posts have made me lose faith in people. I see posts daily of cheaters and how terrible some people can be about it; it makes me think any one of my friends is capable of anything.
      As I said before my gf has never given me any hint of infidelity but this subreddit makes me think anything is possible. She is avidly against cheaters so I always assumed that she would never do anything like that but I say a comment earlier today that said, ""people hate about others what they hate the most about themselves"".

I told some serious whoppers in my time.

Suffice to say my neck was covered in huge Hickeys that were EXTREMELY visible, and had turned into a dark red discolouration by the morning. 

So when I got home and saw my partner I looked her straight in the eye and said 'oh god, I got bit by a spider last night when I was walking to the shops!'. I felt so incredibly guilty and horrible for it. But she somehow believed me.

We broke up shortly afterwards because I couldn't stand the fact I was cheating on her, and because we were all kinds of wrong for each other. But that is another story.

I have a question regarding state taxes, and I cant seem to get a definite answer.

As a college graduate of June 2015, I searched and interviewed for multiple positions before accepting a position in New York state this past February. However, part of the hiring process is a 6-9 month temp period which I'm currently 4 months in to. The temp agency I was referred to is in northern New Jersey, which is where I also live.

My question is: Do I pay both New Jersey and New York taxes, or just New Jersey? I've asked the other temps in my group as well as the temp agency itself and still do not have a definite answer.

I am currently only paying New York state taxes and this doesn't seem right.

POST: I'm someone who has always identified as an alexythemic ( I don't feel or express much emotion), but I still have the basic human need to fit in and appear normal. So I began dating this girl. She seemed great at first and understanding of my need to be on my own sometimes. But as time passed, it became obvious that she is very needy, insecure, self loathing and irrational. She wants things that I can not give her, and the needy things she's pulled in the past like guilt trips, trying to isolate me from firends and family, and control all of my time, have caused resentment to build that I can't get over. I'm a non-confrontational person and I know any attempt to break up with her is going to result in waterworks and more guilt trips. I'm looking for advice on manning up and breaking it off. Any advice would be helpful.

POST: So not long ago I (26M with 24F) [sought advice on a relationship changing from a good friendship to a relationship](

So when we got together after the Christmas break, things were sort of stilted and awkward. I figured something was up, so I didn't make any sort of advances and when she left after last weekend, things got even more distant. By weeks end, I asked her to talk about it and she admitted that she perhaps wasn't as ready for a relationship as she had professed.

That's fine, it is what it is... but now I'm having a bit of a rollercoaster trying to figure out how to rebottle the genie after having a conduit for the feelings I had for her. That said, she's one of the best friends I've had or could ever hope to have and to her, the friendship is ironclad... so if anyone has any thoughts on how I can quash the neuroses and get back into that stride, I'd appreciate it.

We got into talking about what we might do, and I offered dinner, but she always gets dinner with her girlfriends.

She then invited me, and I'm uncertain as to what this means... Is it a good sign, or bad? 

I said yes, because if nothing else it shows confidence, and I'm not afraid to meet new people.

I just don't know what to read into this... Anyone have any advice?

We dated for 2 and a half years and she would get angry at me for any little thing, and I would do what she wanted. I was 100% whipped.

I said I was going to get my shit together and do better this semester but it seems I'm doing the worst...and I can't admit that to any of my family.

I'm working part time at school, making incredible friends, and enjoying my time so much, but I just can't seem to sit down and study.

I work 30 hours a week, for which I'm paid at around the going rate.

I have a job on the side, which I'm allowed to do when I take holiday from my work.

My contact is up for renewal in August, and though the employer is happy with me, they'd be 'grateful' if I reduced or rescheduled my stuff-on-the-side to times that suit them better (which is pretty much impossible).

I've planned a meeting with my Area Manager in July to discuss this and to try and find a solution.

Ideally, I'd be very happy to stop my stuff-on-the-side, but as this would leave me around €4k a year worse off, I'd like to negotiate something better in exchange - an extra €300 a month, or something of similar value would be more than adequate.

I'd appreciate tips on strategy about how to achieve this… and am sure that the kind and wise folk on self.jobs can help me in my goal!

POST: We had something of a mutual breakup - the relationship was stressing us both out. At her behest, we didn't communicate for the better part of 3 months. I then sent her a card for her birthday, one which she then called me to thank me for. 

When she called, she said she'd like to grab dinner sometime - we made plans. She called off the plans bc something came up and she couldn't make it. We rescheduled for Monday and, come Monday, she didn't respond. And she hasn't responded. And now I'm thinking she just doesn't want anything to do with me. 

I was ready to move on and be friends. My guess is she isn't? She wanted to hang out, called it off, and now isn't responding. It's been 4 days and I think that I'll text her once more this weekend and then not contact her at all. Thoughts?

We won because my Father said the wiper was already broken (it was some fancy wiper that was supposed to retract or something, and if it were functioning properly, it would not have been out in the open tempting me to snap it in the first place).

However, the age difference is always in the back of my mind, making me wonder if I'm doing something wrong by dating him.  He's still in college and I've graduated a little while ago... And I know people say that dating younger mean's you're not mature enough to date someone your own age.

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract). But a new contract will end up costing me about $20 more per month for less functionality than my current contract.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I'm starting my senior year in college, and have got a decent chunk of savings from working during breaks/thanks to my (nearly) free tuition.  Right now, I've got almost $30,000 saved up.  I've accepted a job offer for next year for $100,000/yr, so I will be making a good deal of money and have no debt.  

My parents have said that I could stay at home after I graduate for saving up for house/apartment/whatever if I need to.  So, for that first year, I'll have nearly no expenses.  I will be working/living in Boston, MA, USA.

My issue is, I have zero knowledge of anything financial.  I don't know what is a good safe place for money, what do do for real estate (buy/rent), how having this money will affect me in terms of tax/what I can do for this?

TITLE: Is friendship possible after break up?
POST: My [28 M] girlfriend [29 F] of 4 years broke up with me in February citing personal problems (mental issues) and the need for space and time to work things out, though she said she would like us to come back sometime. 

I accepted it because our relationship was going downhill and we're in good therms. 

At first she tried to stay in touch almost hourly, but I asked for silence to get used to her absence, now we text eachother weekly. 

If nothing else, I really want us to be friends in the future because I really care for her and because I do need her friendship. 

But I'm affraid that things cool down way too much and that we're unable to connect again. 

How much time should I wait? 

What kind of contact should I keep?

The strange thing is that they tend to be rather ruthless and fire people with little to no warning, for reasons that are questionably truthful.

The closest feeling I can think of that's similar is when I break-up with some who is obviously not a good fit for me. Which is usually followed by doubts about whether or not I should get back with my ex.

My friend found this video immensely amusing, while I just cringed and basically got angry as to people laughing at this life threatening accident. We get into a heated argument about why that is funny, and basically his whole argument revolved around the guy was videotaping himself climb a tree, he fell, that's funny cause he is stupid. 

Please help me understand why some people find this humorous?

I have two questions, one is to people who do/did get bored of relationships easily, how did you overcome that if you even managed to?

The other question is to people who have dealt with someone with these issues before. How did you deal with them, did you manage to overcome them and have a succesful relationship? or should I not even bother? 

Thanks.

POST: I'm a male in my third year of college. Because of personal issues, I haven't really had a chance to make any friends. I want to start talking to more people to get social skills.

I thought a good idea would be to talk to girls in my class. I'm not really in a position to date anyone right now, so I just want to be friends.

My classes are usually pretty big with a lot of empty seats, so I'm afraid that if I just go sit beside a girl and try talking to her, even though their are a ton of other empty seats, she'll think I'm hitting on her and I'll scare her off.

So my question is, how do I talk to girls in class without them thinking I'm hitting on them and getting scared off? Also, because of being a loner my entire life, I'm extremely awkward and have no social skills whatsoever, so the conversations are going to be very awkward for both of us at first.

In France, we have about 20% charges on the ""brut"" salary, which then gives us the real remuneration. For example, if your remuneration is **30k€/year**, that will make you **24k€/year real remuneration** (or 2k/month).

However, I've recently obtained a job interview for what could be a dream job in the gaming industry in **Ireland**.

So obviously one of the first questions I had to myself was : 

Well, how can I know what will the life cost in another country? That way I would know better what to ask as a salary during my job interview.

Other than that, there is a lot of information to be found (like the cost of a flat, the taxes, etc) and I have only 2 days to get everything.

TITLE: [20/f] Etiquette advice needed for breaking up with my semi-long-distance boyfriend [22/m]?
POST: Hey. 20F dating 22M for almost four months, and things just aren't really working out. I want to have feelings for him, but I don't.

Anyway, we're in a not-quite-long-distance relationship--he lives an hour away and drives to see me once a week. I know that generally when breaking up with someone you're supposed to do it face-to-face, but I feel like it would be unfair to make him drive all the way to see me only to be broken up with and have to drive back. Would a phone call be acceptable?

Also, if he asks why specifically I'm breaking up with him, how in depth should I go? I mean, there aren't any smoking guns or anything, I just... I don't miss him when he's not around, and I don't get excited to see him apart from the sex.

POST: So, I've been seeing/dating this girl now for a month (Feb 3rd). Things are going really good. I am 30 she is 27. We got really close last sunday (19th). This past saturday, we were in bed talking. I had asked her if she went on any dates with other people besides me. She said yes. She went on a date with some guy the second week into meeting each other and kissed him, but that there wasn't a real connection. 

This upset me...a lot. I know we're not exclusive and we're just dating right now. Am I wrong to feel bad? Is she wrong for going on another date with someone? She knows how I feel. She feels the same. She doesn't want to jump into anything serious so soon. She says she wants things to happen on their own and not force them so early. 

I've been out of the dating game for a long time and I really like this girl. I don't know what to think anymore.

Neither of us were interested in having an affair but after another month we started spending a lot of time together.  Eventually she felt that we should have some space from each other, which I reluctantly agreed with.  Looking back now I see that it was the right decision but at the time it really hurt.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

POST: So I've been through a series of bad relationships in the past few years, including getting engaged to my gf of four years before she cheated on me and dumped me. After that, I dated a girl that really cared about me, but I didn't feel the same way, and ended up hurting her by breaking up with her. (I can share more if anyone wants, or finds it relevant)

Basically, I have a girl that I'm interested in, and I'm afraid to ask her out, knowing all the baggage I have. I'm a caring person, I guess, and I want to ask her out, but I don't want to hurt her with all my baggage and hangups.

POST: We broke up on December 17, 2015.  

After the break-up, I realized just how much she meant to me.  I love her, and am still in love with her.  She's moved on (She had another guy over at her place on December 18th...)

It was tough, but I mostly got over it.  For the past 2 weeks, however, I've realized I enjoy listening to songs that remind me of her.  Songs that are related to love and such (Think Taylor Swift, 1989).  I've realized that I'm definitely not over her.  I still love her.

My question is why do I enjoy making myself sad by thinking about her?  Is this normal?  Has anyone else ever experienced this?  I find myself going out for walks just so I can listen to songs which bring back all of the old memories... Why?

I wound up applying to intern on a sustainable farm this summer, and got accepted. When I got the acceptance email, however, I discovered that my girlfriend's ex (who goes to the same school as I do) will also be interning there.

So basically, I'm going to be stuck all summer at a tiny farm with my girlfriend's ex. There are a total of four interns there, so I can't really avoid her. The thing is, she doesn't know that my gf and I are together. Should I tell her beforehand, and if so, how? Or am I better off just keeping things a secret?

TITLE: [16/m] Broke up with my [16/f] long-distance girlfriend.
POST: OK, so here's the deal. About a month ago, I broke up with my girlfriend, we were doing the whole long-distance thing. In the moment I was completely taken by emotions,(hormones too.) and I told her how much I cared for her, even told her I loved her.(First time I've ever said that to a girl.) In response, she told me she didn't feel the same anymore, and she just wanted to be friends.

She had started to become distant weeks before, and I knew it wasn't working... Anyway, several days ago, she sent me a email, asking to talk on Skype. So I accepted, and the next day we talk. All she wanted to do was have small talk. I was fairly offended, and cut her off, and logged off. At this point, I'm not really sure what I should do next. And I was hoping Reddit could give me some ideas, or whatever.

POST: I play on an indoor soccer league that runs 5v5 with a keeper each. We play on turf and boards (think hockey rink) and because of the turf and how close the shooter is, I get absolutely rocked while playing keeper. 

I wear decent ($100 ish) keeper gloves that have the plastic spines behind the fingers to help protect you from having your fingers overextend but even with those my pinky and ring fingers really hurt. Sometimes I take a particularly hard shot and I mess up my wrist.

Normally I would tape up my two fingers together but since I am wearing gloves it prevents that and I really don't want to tape them on the outside. Any suggestions is welcomed.

TITLE: Me [24M] with my ex [23F] of 3 years, she sent me a big bag of bad etiquette.
POST: After the breakup, I sent her, via mutual friends, a bag of her stuff that she left at my house. She sent in return, a bag of gifts I gave to her, including a t-shirt which still stunk of her sweat. Couldn't even launder it before sending it back. I know I didn't send her any dirty clothes.

Furthermore, she didn't send ALL the gifts I gave to her, just, I guess, the ones she didn't want.

Is she trying to make me feel even worse? Does she not understand breakup etiquette? Do I not understand it? Am I missing something here? Am I warranted in feeling so insulted or am I just looking for something to be mad about because I'm so hurt by the breakup itself?

POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again.

I noticed that during the week, when I'm watching TV or browsing reddit, I tend to get hungrier more often. I just want to eat when I know I shouldn't. But on the weekends I eat less than I usually do and don't seem to get hungry.

Something about focusing or getting entirely absorbed in a good game somehow gets me through a whole day, almost forgetting to eat. I've experienced the same thing when reading or writing something, anything that gets me to focus all of my attention on it.

POST: Three weeks ago I quit my job waiting tables to take a job opening a brand new restaurant in a very nice neighborhood.  The restaurant is known nation wide and the new store is 10,000+ square feet, so they hired around 70 servers to help open. Tonight was a dry run for friends and family and before the shift he called out names, including mine, said that he needed to talk to us all outside before the shift.  With a frown on his face, the corporate trainer told us, ""There's no easy way to do this.  We are making some changes, and we've decided to let you all go... HOME FOR THE NIGHT!""  He then explains that we are all the top servers there and he wants us to be the ones who wait on the bloggers/critics.  I almost threw up all over the place.

POST: We've been in a long distance relationship for about 5 months now, and it's been amazing. However, the past week or so, when we text she seems uninterested. She used to actively converse with me and it was great, but now she's just throwing one liners at me. She never really contributes to the conversation either. I constantly find myself struggling to come up with a topic to talk about because she just doesn't contribute anymore. It makes me feel like she just doesn't want to talk to me anymore, and it sucks really. Just the other day we were typing to each other on skype, when she told me she was going to do something right quick. She was ""gone"" for an hour, but was posting on a website we both go to during that time.

Am I overreacting? I just really hate how it makes me feel..

POST: We've been together a couple of months and everything is going swimmingly, I'm wrapped in him and couldn't be happier. 

So, the other day he brought up having dinner with his family and it made me really nervous and I don't know why. The thought just makes me feel apprehensive. I don't think I'm worried about giving a bad impression, and it doesn't feel like things are moving too fast or anything, but I do feel daunted.

I do get nervous meeting new people, but it's worth noting that I've met both his parents briefly in passing, so they're not complete strangers to me.

He knows exactly where I'm at and that I feel like this, and so we're holding off for now...I just wouldn't mind some other perspectives/advice/thoughts as I do actually want to meet them properly. Even some suggestions on how to make it easier or something.

So I am 22 years old, and just got my first job out of university (yay!) 

I plan on working with a $36k salary (with benefits and vacation time) as of late May, and a part time retail job on the weekends. 

I am currently living at home for free (thank god for parents) and as of today, I have approximately $41k in student loans, $200 in credit card debt, no savings and no major expenses besides my phone bill. 

My plan is to save and pay off as much of my student loans in six months and move out by January of next year. Would I be in a good position to move out? I would probably rent and have roommates if I do move out and it would help me lots since the commute is killer!

I live in Ontario, Canada by the way.

POST: Hello all.

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off? For example, I know most males aren't supposed to eat fewer than 1500 calories a day, and when I do (or did, should I say) the weight loss just isn't as prominent (not to mention that at below this point, the body's chemicals start to unbalance).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

In all do honesty, his current music isn't what we're all fans of, but keep in mind, he's young. He can't sing about dramatic life experiences, breakups, or heart ache, because he hasn't experienced that yet.

Most people on r/relationships advocate not getting back together with exes as they are exes for a reason. So how are long term relationships supposed to work? How do people stay together for so long? I feel as though there is such a fine line to having a relationship that lasts a lifetime especially in today's society.

I've been dating him for over a year now and recently he has decided to go back to college. However, due to poor financial decisions in the past, he has no money, no job, and doesn't really actively seek a job.

Instead, I'm paying for almost everything for him and it's frustrating because I just got a full time, salaried position, and I can't even enjoy the money I'm making because I have to save money to pay for things like his car payments and gas money. He doesn't have his own place and just crashes at his friend's. The problem is that I'm too nice to cut him off and every time I push him to get a job by reminding him of all the things I'm paying for, he turns it on me and accuses me of ""keeping track"", which I am not.

POST: I'm a fairly successful comic in my city's local scene. My best friend has been to a few shows recently, and decided that she's interested in performing at some upcoming open mic events.

She's been writing material and asking me to look at it for her and tell her if it's funny. To be blunt, it isn't. She doesn't seem to be particularly suited to writing comedy.

I've been trying to help her workshop, which she asked me to do, but I'm starting to think that there's not anything I can really do to help her make the material stronger. It's just not that good to begin with, and anything I can think to do to improve it just makes it sound like MY comedy, not something of her own.

What's the best way to tell her that I don't think she's cut out for this? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't want her to end up embarrassed.

Follow by him responding with a frown face she then replies. ""Whats the face for babe?""

TITLE: What are some subtle but effective ways to gain positive attention from shy men?
POST: I have tried the obvious: eye contact, coy smile, dressing nicely. I make jokes and laugh at jokes. I am female and not unattractive. I'm confident sometimes but shy and tastefully flirtatious for the most part. Truthfully, I get plenty of attention from men at parties and social gatherings. But of course the one guy who I have an interest in doesn't respond to anything I do. 

This guy is sort of shy, and I think he enjoys the eye contact and half smiles we send each other, but I want to take it further without seeming too forward. In other words, I want to flirt enough to provoke him to make a move.

Upset and feeling like it was time to move on anyway, I wanted to give my notice and quit.

This would allow me to be paid for a couple months while not working and look for my next job.

She seemed great at first and understanding of my need to be on my own sometimes. But as time passed, it became obvious that she is very needy, insecure, self loathing and irrational. She wants things that I can not give her, and the needy things she's pulled in the past like guilt trips, trying to isolate me from firends and family, and control all of my time, have caused resentment to build that I can't get over. I'm a non-confrontational person and I know any attempt to break up with her is going to result in waterworks and more guilt trips. I'm looking for advice on manning up and breaking it off.

My parents are around all week to look after a dog, but they work full days and are probably not going to be home for at least 6 hours a day at a time.

The relationship - perfect to me, and to her she loves it for a while, then she starts to see me as a friend again and doesn't feel like she wants to be in a relationship. We end it, then both of us go crawling back to each other, she's usually the one who initiates contact again usually when we agree to stop speaking for a while.

We are currently in an on/off relationship and I need your advice as to whether I should just try persevere and keep chasing the relationship, or whether I should move on.

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone. When I first got him, about a week ago, I was taking him out every 2-3 hours but could rarely get him to goto the bathroom. Instead, he just comes inside walks around my apartment for 10 minutes and then goes. I've tried every hour on the hour as well. It's been a week now and he's consistently doing this no matter how long we take him out for. We went on a nice long walk yesterday (thanks to warm weather) and he barely sniffed the ground. But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times. What am I doing wrong? Any tips are appreciated!

When I was a child my father had a monthly subscription for some space magazine. The way it worked:
They sent us a large 4 inch binder with several starter articles about space and every month they would send 4 new articles (one for every week I assume) to add to the binder. These articles included information about the stars, planets, important/key figures involved in space exploration, key events and the technology behind it all.
Now that I'm a father I'm looking for the same or similar program for my daughter. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about or something similar?

POST: The constant reminder of her via Facebook, instagram and the like was preventing me from finding any peace. I mean how can you forget someone when they are top on the FB chat list all the time?

It was an 9 month relationship of pure bliss, but for some reason she bailed. Told me I was perfect yada yada. Only guy to make her Orgasm/biggest guy. I was completely blindsided by it, she assured me there was no one else. I believe her about that. Its her last year at Uni and she had a lot on the plate, understandable. But I really only saw her on the weekends. I guess I wont understand.

POST: > Hey, sorry to bother you. Could you unfollow me? I'm guessing you just forgot, but it would help if you did. Thanks. Hope you're good. Bye.

This is the message I want to send him. Around 2 months ago, we cut all ties, following a talk about the previous ~3-6 months of him apparently not giving a shit about me. This has been tough for me, but I've succeeded in mostly keeping him out of my life. I haven't talked to him. I try not to let him get in the way of things in my head (and fail sometimes).

The problem is he still follows me on Twitter. And I've only got like 10 followers, so every time I'm on Twitter, I'm just sort of aware of him there. 90% chance he muted me during the aforementioned 3-6 months and doesn't see anything I post. But it still bothers me.

The strange thing is that they tend to be rather ruthless and fire people with little to no warning, for reasons that are questionably truthful.
However, instead of jumping for joy, I feel saddened and a little depressed. I even thought about taking back my notice of resignation because of how saddened they seemed.
The closest feeling I can think of that's similar is when I break-up with some who is obviously not a good fit for me. Which is usually followed by doubts about whether or not I should get back with my ex.

Vet said she has tapeworms, prescribed her flea medication and tape worm medication and gave her a shot for nausea. She was still okay this morning even with the vomiting, but now since we've been back home she hasn't moved much, is drooling excessively from the mouth, won't eat, won't drink, and just kind of sits upright and stares into the blue until she gets tired and lays down curled up.

I am a good listener and enjoy hearing what people have to say and I will answer questions just briefly. I tend to show friendliness through favors, helping out, paying for stuff without asking for money back, that sort of stuff.

However I'm not good at making new friends because I'm not a good conversationalist. And I've never even been on a date because I'm not good at talking to girls. I've been trying to get a date for the 2 years I've been in college and I haven't had a luck because it's against my nature to engage someone in conversation.

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

A lot of people are aware of this happening, including the close friends of the guy who got cheated on, the guy still knows nothing about it.

This article speaks to me in a lot of ways--I already have Google Voice as my primary phone number, I was hoping to upgrade to a Galaxy Nexus, and  adopting a 5GB data plan with no voice/text element would potentially save me about $15-25/mo. That said, buying a phone off contract is a much larger one-time expense compared to upgrading ($400 versus $150 with a new contract).

POST: My boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months. I usually spend the weekends over at his place. For the past month, a mutual friend of his and his roommate as been coming around every Saturday or Sunday. Seems like whenever she comes by or has something going on at her place we end up hanging out with her/doing what she wants to do. 

She's known my boyfriend and his roommate for a while. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable because it seems like she has zero interest in getting to know me/talking to me. I also have a gut feeling that she might be interested in my boyfriend but I have nothing really to back it up. I just don't feel comfortable hanging out around her and it makes me look forward less to the weekends because now I can expect to see her.

I don't know how to bring this up without sounding weird and jealous.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

POST: In the past 5 months she has been to three funerals. She's only 18 and eventhough she's a really strong person, it's too much for her to handle.
We keep a long distance relationship so I can't go to her and comfort her in person, only via MSN for now.

Just 30 minutes ago her grandmother passed, she doesn't know what to do with herself and she guilts herself for what happened.
She got 20.000 DKK (danish currency) as a christmas present from her grandmother in the mail minutes after she had found out her grandmother passed.
She guilts herself with the fact that when she visited her grandma yesterday, she said ""Good night, I will see you tomorrow"" but never did.

I'm running out of words to tell her, help me please.

POST: I realize the traditional advice is to continue to build up a nest egg, retire, and then leisure through life into the death.  But if you have the means to take a few months (maybe even years?), is it that crazy to take some time off while you're young and healthy?

I probably have the funds (outside of retirement) to last several years without any income and much more if I'm doing some small side projects.  This is without touching retirement.  And this is without cutting down my current lifestyle.

On the other hand, health insurance may be an issue? And what about getting blackballed out of the workforce (software industry, of course).

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off?

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

We are a three adult household (plus child on the way) renting a house from a property management company.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

POST: In the past three months I've reduced my total debt from about $20,000 to $9,200.  While it's possible I can do the same for the $9,200 with commissions I am not and have not budgeted for possibilities.

I've budgeted out the next year based on my minimum income with no commission.  This plan sees me debt free by August 2016.  All of my expenses are covered, and any commission I receive  moves my debt-free date forward.

The budget factors in savings, my HSA, and my simple IRA to get my employers max contribution.

My question is, now what?  All I do is eat, sleep, work, gym, and repeat.  I've deactivated Facebook, I don't party, I quit drinking, and I got rid of my car since I live in a metroplex and walk or uber pretty much everywhere I need to go.  This actually costs less than having a car in my situation.

Here's a for-instance: lets say you break up with your S.O. and a few months later you decide you want them back. I see two groups:

- People who are just lonely and want to get back with anyone, and the ex starts looking better and better

- People who took a look at their actions, made some corrections, and want to try to patch things up

Say for the sake of argument that we're talking about the latter case, what can you do to reach out that's romantic but not creepy?

We've been on 3 dates and they have all been so much fun! We laugh a lot and truly enjoy each other's company. The only thing is that he hasn't once tried to make a move.

The dates are utterly amazing and then when it's time to say goodbye it gets awkward. I know that he's a really shy guy but I'm worried maybe I'm just in over my head and he may just want to be friends.

Also want to add that we text each other the days we don't see each other or have class and he's always telling me I'm beautiful. I like him more and more through each conversation but I don't want to get turned down if I try to make a move the next time we have a date!

Mom and I got into a heated argument about college. She claimed she didn't have the money to have me and my 3 sisters in college at the same time. My mom makes good money, she's a surgeon and my dad's a well respected and busy lawyer.

I really liked reading about each characters powers and their origin stories but that was all on Wikipedia. I want the real thing. Where should I start though?

So anywho, any suggestions on a good place to start for a new comic book reader would be very appreciated. Thanks!

This doesn't agree with me because I have to spend a lot of time in the studio. I aced my first text, but the homework is graded like a take-home test. I got a bad grade on the homework because I didn't have the time to do it thoroughly. I really need help. I know the material, but don't have the time to sort through the hundreds of pages of text that each unit covers. 

The book is The Principles of Learning and Behavior, sixth edition by Michael Domjan. I need the answers to the work book. Any help or direction is appreciated.

POST: Hello,

So, basically i need some advice. After leaving High School (2 years ago) i decided to get a job working for a food chain company (first ever job). Worked their for 3 months or so and decided to leave and go to University however, while leaving i didn't have the most positive experience.

Now, finishing the first semester of uni, i found out that my Overseas trip (planned before starting uni and said to be OK by the Uni) would in fact not be OK and that No matter what i could do, my week long trip would result in failing of all papers that semester. (Uni refunded costs of semester after much debate)

So, its now been 7 months since i have been working or studying. I decided a month ago, i wouldn't return to Uni This Semester (just over it and needed a break). I currently owe about 12000 in student loan and 3000 or so to my parents who lent me some money and i need some advice.
