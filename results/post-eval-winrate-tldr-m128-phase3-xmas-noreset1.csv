TITLE: Me [31 m] with this girl I was kind of seeing [27 F] 4 years, broke up and she keeps texting me to ""check in""
POST: Me and and a girl broke up this summer after years. I guess we were never really dating...its complicated. Anyways she has moved on. Dating, new town, new job, new friends. And I respect that but she says she wants to still be friends because I am important to her. Anyways I had heard from her in a month or so. She randomly text me, ""Hey, how are things going?"" I respond ""fine, how are you?"" and she says nothing for 30 minutes or so. So I ask ""is everything ok?"" she says ""Yes, just checking in."" and that was it. 2 weeks later....she text me again...ask how i am and i say fine,m you just checking in...she says ""yup"". To me that sounds like she thinks she has to be nice and check in every so often until she doesn't have to. Am I correct or crazy? and how should I approach her without sounding like a dick?

POST: Just like the title says. I read these posts daily because it was automatically added to my front page (on mobile). 

My(20M) gf (20) has never done anything in our relationship that has led me to believe she would do something that could hurt me but these posts have made me lose faith in people. I see posts daily of cheaters and how terrible some people can be about it; it makes me think any one of my friends is capable of anything.
      As I said before my gf has never given me any hint of infidelity but this subreddit makes me think anything is possible. She is avidly against cheaters so I always assumed that she would never do anything like that but I say a comment earlier today that said, ""people hate about others what they hate the most about themselves"". I think I need to stop looking at these posts.

It was basically a list of a bunch of people (or entities) in asylums that kept keys or something along those lines, and for each one person, you would have to go to the asylum or hospital, ask the receptionist, and she would take you to some desolate hallway where there would be a keeper. Also, while you were there, you had to do some task, like never open your eyes. All of the keepers had names like ""Keeper of Light"" or ""Keeper of Blood"" or something. Any info would help.

TITLE: New rescue won't go to the bathroom outside
POST: Everyone on here is always giving good advice so I was hoping to poll you guys as well. Here's my issue:

I recently adopted a pretty abused Yorkie, he's two years old and is very timid around everyone. When I first got him, about a week ago, I was taking him out every 2-3 hours but could rarely get him to goto the bathroom. Instead, he just comes inside walks around my apartment for 10 minutes and then goes. I've tried every hour on the hour as well. It's been a week now and he's consistently doing this no matter how long we take him out for. We went on a nice long walk yesterday (thanks to warm weather) and he barely sniffed the ground. But, as soon as we came in, he went to the bathroom within 15 minutes. His foster mother said he knew to go outside but in the 8 days we've had him, he's only went outside about 7 or 8 times. What am I doing wrong? Any tips are appreciated!

TITLE: How can I get my live-in landlord to change his rules without causing tension?
POST: So, this person is exceptionally difficult. There are a bunch of annoying rules he's imposed post-me moving in, he's probably the stingiest person I've ever met, and he's decided that it's acceptable for the heat to be at 5ºC when no one's home, 10ºC when sleeping, and 15ºC when someone's home and awake (41, 50, and 59ºF, respectively) thus resulting in me being fucking freezing always. I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June. The most annoying part about it is that he goes about telling me the rules with a ""that's the way things are"" attitude, and like, I understand it's his house, but I'm paying rent, damnit. And a third of utilities.

We broke up in October after I left for college and he stayed home. 

Since then there hasn't really been a clean break (still have flirted and hooked up when i'm home) but he has told me several times, ""I've changed, I want to be single and do my own thing. I still care about you and there's still a special bond, just not romantic"" 

It hurts every time. But I don't really want a relationship either. I just don't want to let go of the past, so I'm afraid of really breaking things off (no contact style) and not seeing him over the summer (even though he would still live in a different town, just closer)

I just don't know if it's worth the stress or if it's what I really want. It kinda makes me sick to realize how much I think about it.

POST: Hi guys,

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

What should I do now?

POST: So here's the deal Reddit, I LOVED the recently ended (my heart still aches) Young Justice series. Because of this I feel like I would really enjoy superhero comics if I was lead in the right direction. I really liked reading about each characters powers and their origin stories but that was all on Wikipedia. I want the real thing. Where should I start though? I tried reading an old Teen Titans comic a while back but got bored and distracted pretty easily. I know I would respond better to something more modern, sorry if that makes me a heretic :/. So anywho, any suggestions on a good place to start for a new comic book reader would be very appreciated. Thanks!

POST: Hey everyone... First post on reddit, so please forgive me if I make any mistakes. Anyway, basically what I'm looking for is any words of wisdom, or to hear from someone in a similar position. Or tips on how to deal with any of it, any insight is appreciated.

I went to school for a year and a half at one place, then went to cc for a semester, and then came here. I swore up and down that this is what I wanted to do, so my parents agreed and boom, here I am 12 hours from home. I'm doing pretty well in my classes, but I just hate being so far from my family because we are so close. I feel pretty badly about spending so much money on out of state tuition as well, even though my family can afford it. It's a great school and I like it here, but life just isn't the same with my family so far away.

TITLE: Dear Reddit, are there any car salesman/dealers out there?
POST: I have been told so many different things by people who are NOT car salesman and i was hoping reddit could clear things up for me.

Last month I leased a new 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe.  

My question is, how much wiggle room is there really in a lease?  The car i just leased is a 4 cyl engine...Now, after having driven it around town, i really wish i had gone for the V6, as everyone says the gas mileage really isn't that much different, and the power IS.  Also, the sound system is crap, and i would prefer the upgraded model with the better system.

Some people have told me i could take it back now and they probably would trade the car for me, do a new lease, (seeing as how i want to Upgrade).  This seems  too far fetched.  I figure i will have to wait at least 2-3 years ( i signed for a 4 year lease) before that is even an option.

Getting away from my specific Forever Aloneness for a moment, I'm left wondering: where is the line between a romantic gesture and creepy stalking? I clearly lost track of it somewhere.

Here's a for-instance: lets say you break up with your S.O. and a few months later you decide you want them back. I see two groups:

- People who are just lonely and want to get back with anyone, and the ex starts looking better and better

- People who took a look at their actions, made some corrections, and want to try to patch things up

POST: My wife and I have had our share of ups and downs for the past 2 years we've been married.  We recently ""separated"" for 11 days, and I just returned home.  We talked a lot, and agreed we have some real issues.  Primarily, she has trust issues with me.  Since I've been home (one night) things have been great between us, when we don't directly discuss our marriage.  Even our sex life has been on a totally new level.

We are going to go through marriage counseling weekly at least.  During that period, we are entertaining her moving out to a nearby apartment while I stay in the home.  We will still be married and committed to each other, just not living together.  Is this a normal thing to do?  Is this a good thing to do?  Or would that just be the start of the end?

POST: My girlfriend and I are struggling with spending time together. I work a demanding job, with hours that are typically from 8-5:30, sometimes I work more 8-6 or 9-6. I also occasionally have to work weekends. I wish I had more time to spend with my girlfriend, but sometimes work gets in the way.

My girlfriend also feels we don't get to spend much time together. When I do get home from work, the conversations always go to how much I've been working. I feel like she focuses on me having to go to work the next day instead of getting to spend the time we are actually together enjoying ourselves.

How can we focus on enjoying the time we do have together instead of worrying about not being able to spend much time together the next day?

They sent us a large 4 inch binder with several starter articles about space and every month they would send 4 new articles (one for every week I assume) to add to the binder. These articles included information about the stars, planets, important/key figures involved in space exploration, key events and the technology behind it all.
Now that I'm a father I'm looking for the same or similar program for my daughter. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about or something similar?

POST: This person is my step dad (of 6 months)'s first cousin, so I guess that would make him my step half cousin?

We have met a few times and gotten along great, but I didn't think of it as more than that until this happened. I think he's cool and everything and would probably consider opportunity if I didn't consider him *part of the family*.  BUT then again, we are nowhere near blood related, not even distantly, so?

TITLE: Can I train for a marathon with cross-training twice a week?
POST: I'm considering doing a marathon in April, but I'm wondering whether I can continue doing capoeira twice a week while I train. Here's my deal: Mondays and Fridays I do capoeira, and Sundays and every other Friday I do the hash (tamer European version though, so I can get away with just one post-run beer). I'm wondering whether only 4 runs a week (assuming I take a real rest day), one of which is the hash, could be enough for marathon training. That would give me one hash, one long run, and just two normal runs per week. That wouldn't even be 30mi at first.

My current level: standard run is a 10k at around 52:00 (fastest is a 48:00), longest run I've ever done is a half marathon (not in a race, just ran 13.1 mi on my own). So I'm an ok runner, but I still haven't crossed over into being truly serious about it.

But, the hat that arrived at my house was red. I followed zazzle's instructions for requesting an exchange. To be honest, I didn't even think I would be able to get an exchange because the receipt said I ordered a red one... yeah I might have accidentally ordered a red one. But I requested the exchange for the white hat, and zazzle customer service responded the next day. They were extremely apologetic and said that no exchange was necessary. They said I was free to do with the red hat as I wished. Keep it, sell it, discard it, whatever. And they would send me the white hat I wanted at no extra cost. This, friends, gave me faith in humanity.

Since then there hasn't really been a clean break (still have flirted and hooked up when i'm home) but he has told me several times, ""I've changed, I want to be single and do my own thing. I still care about you and there's still a special bond, just not romantic"" 

It hurts every time. But I don't really want a relationship either. I just don't want to let go of the past, so I'm afraid of really breaking things off (no contact style) and not seeing him over the summer (even though he would still live in a different town, just closer)

I just don't know if it's worth the stress or if it's what I really want. It kinda makes me sick to realize how much I think about it.

TITLE: Separate or stay together during marriage counseling? M31, F27, married 2 years
POST: My wife and I have had our share of ups and downs for the past 2 years we've been married.  We recently ""separated"" for 11 days, and I just returned home.  We talked a lot, and agreed we have some real issues.  Primarily, she has trust issues with me.  Since I've been home (one night) things have been great between us, when we don't directly discuss our marriage.  Even our sex life has been on a totally new level.

We are going to go through marriage counseling weekly at least.  During that period, we are entertaining her moving out to a nearby apartment while I stay in the home.  We will still be married and committed to each other, just not living together.  Is this a normal thing to do?  Is this a good thing to do?  Or would that just be the start of the end?

Well, how can I know what will the life cost in another country? That way I would know better what to ask as a salary during my job interview.

Other than that, there is a lot of information to be found (like the cost of a flat, the taxes, etc) and I have only 2 days to get everything.

TITLE: Finding Cosigners Outside of Family
POST: I'm not asking anyone here to cosign, I know that's against the rules, and it's not really what I'm gunning for. Here's my story:

I have not yet graduated from my school, but I haven't been enrolled for ~15 months. I will remain a student until I independently finish this one last requirement and get cleared for graduation.

My mom may need to move soon, and she'll need to get a mortgage on a new house. She's also the cosigner on my (private) student loans, totaling ~$123k. With that debt hanging over her, she and her wife can't get a mortgage.

Consolidating my loans is something I've been intending to do regardless. I want to do it to get the loans out of her name, but despite a decent salary ($60k), my debt-to-income ratio and credit score are too high to qualify independently for just about any options. What I really need is someone who can cosign a consolidation.

One day,  though,  I was getting out of the shower and became extremely confused, which really scared me so I stopped the medication. 

That was all before I started school.  Since this semester began I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety.   For a while I was handling that, until my grades started to fall.  After that I became unmotivated, lethargic,  and irritable.

He started to walk around a bit earlier but has just been sleeping since, and wont let the other cats play with him. I can't really tell if his leg is swollen or not but he definitely seems to be in pain.

My question is, how long should I give him to see if he's going to start walking on it comfortably again? I'd rather not take a trip to the vet just to have them tell me ""give it some time"", considering that's been the usual answer I've been getting with most of my cat related problems recently.

It's usually about 10 - 13 mph).

TITLE: Mother with abusive Boyfriend. Need Advice.
POST: Hi Reddit,

So my mother as been dating an ex drogue addicted (seems clean, dough he smokes some joints every now and then.)

She breaked up with him and he became very stalker-ish and calling all the time and sending sms's all day.

Some months have passed and now my sister says that they are together again, and that he is very possessive and keeps calling all the time to know were she is and with who, and in a very aggressive manner.

My mother wont listen to anyone that says that he is a dangerous person and that she should dump him for good. She keeps saying that he only turn against him-self (threat to kill him self, etc...), and not against other people.

So, what can I say that would make her see the danger? (me and my sister are out of the house for years now, so no problem there)

It's all been fun and whatnot, but we were pretty cautious about calling ourselves a couple, both had some previous stuff mess up our heads. We've had a crush on each other since october, but started really acting on things ~2 months ago. Now, it has steadily evolved and we seem perfectly fine and happy and all that jazz, but recently I've been feeling that something's not right. Everything is seemingly perfectly fine, but for some reason I get the idea stuck in my head she's not as involved as she usually would. I wouldn't want to seem like I'm trying too hard or am too invasive too, which makes me unsure how to act. I have a history of overthinking and worry I might just be paranoid, which will lead me to trying too hard or something.

Any advice Redditors? I REALLY wouldn't want this one to go well.

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

A lot of people are aware of this happening, including the close friends of the guy who got cheated on, the guy still knows nothing about it.

By telling him I feel I'd be causing the guy unnecessary pain... But on the other hand, maybe I'm this guy's only chance to avoid him going down a long dark road which he may choose to avoid given he knows all the facts.

TITLE: How do I get/help my wife to femme it up a little?
POST: I love her and this is not, **repeat not**, a deal-breaker but I'd like her to be more feminine. She grew up basically feral, has no female relatives any less feral, and is too embarrassed to talk to her friends.
Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

But silliness aside, how much flak do you think I'm likely to get for this, whether to my face or behind my back? I've heard guys a year younger than me say 19 is too young, so I'm a bit worried about it.

To be clear, I see no earthly reason why maturity should be an issue. She's wrapped up three semesters of university with the most recent being spent living abroad, and I feel like I'm somewhat behind where I ""should be"" in the maturity game since I spent three years (from Grade 12 until the summer after my second year of university) being pretty much too depressed to leave my room.

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

TITLE: Put an offer on a house, need some sound advice Reddit.
POST: I got a loan approval through my bank at $160,000.00, saw a house on the market at $169,900.00 and basically after weeks of searching, decided this would be the house for me. My realtor and I figured we could get it with an offer of $160,000.00 because it had been on the market at the list price with no offers for nearly two months.

The seller's agent called my loan officer attempting to get me approved for higher so they could try to still sell it to me, but at list price. My realtor isn't budging and neither is my loan officer, so at this point is there anything I could do to sway the seller's mind on selling higher?

TITLE: My negativity is affecting my relationship. How can I become a more positive person?

The worst part is how it is hurting my boyfriend. He is an optimist and my negativity is really starting to affect our relationship. I can be perfectly happy and having fun while complaining, but he (totally understandably) feels like I hate my life and everything about it. This, in turn, makes him feel like a bad boyfriend because I am so unhappy.

I want to be a positive, upbeat person that others like to be around. I don't need to change my life, I love my life. I need to change how I see it, how I relate to it, and how I communicate that. I don't just want to not complain, I want to be more positive. Help?

So when we got together after the Christmas break, things were sort of stilted and awkward.

That's fine, it is what it is... but now I'm having a bit of a rollercoaster trying to figure out how to rebottle the genie after having a conduit for the feelings I had for her. That said, she's one of the best friends I've had or could ever hope to have and to her, the friendship is ironclad... so if anyone has any thoughts on how I can quash the neuroses and get back into that stride, I'd appreciate it.

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

POST: We were doing really well as we overcame some difficult obstacles and gone through some rough fights. But everything was going smoothly and we were still in love. 

Then, just overnight, she said she wanted to break up because she has been talking to a guy behind my back and she started developing feeling for him. If she wanted to join a religion and be closer to God then that's perfectly fine with me. But the fact that she joined for a guy makes me sick and confused.

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Am I wrong for thinking that she is nuts or too immature to be in an adult relationship if she can just jump ship like that? I have a feeling that I'm better off without her.

We broke up in June. It wasn't easy for me. I didn't feel like I got enough closure and she just dropped off the face of the earth. 

Well I've been dating this new girl called T for a month or so and shes great, tall, blonde, sweet, gorgeous, looks like Blake Lively sp?. I know that in most situations this would be great, my ex saw me with a gorgeous girl and I looked happy.

But I dont feel good about it, I dont feel like I won something. I feel bad because I still care a lot about her (the ex) and I wish we were still friends. Should I just continue the no contact, or should I reach out and see if she wants coffee sometime? I already broke the no contact, I sent her a small email that just said ""You look good"". No reply.

POST: We had something of a mutual breakup - the relationship was stressing us both out. At her behest, we didn't communicate for the better part of 3 months. I then sent her a card for her birthday, one which she then called me to thank me for. 

When she called, she said she'd like to grab dinner sometime - we made plans. She called off the plans bc something came up and she couldn't make it. We rescheduled for Monday and, come Monday, she didn't respond. And she hasn't responded. And now I'm thinking she just doesn't want anything to do with me. 

I was ready to move on and be friends. My guess is she isn't? She wanted to hang out, called it off, and now isn't responding. It's been 4 days and I think that I'll text her once more this weekend and then not contact her at all. Thoughts?

But silliness aside, how much flak do you think I'm likely to get for this, whether to my face or behind my back? I've heard guys a year younger than me say 19 is too young, so I'm a bit worried about it.

To be clear, I see no earthly reason why maturity should be an issue. She's wrapped up three semesters of university with the most recent being spent living abroad, and I feel like I'm somewhat behind where I ""should be"" in the maturity game since I spent three years (from Grade 12 until the summer after my second year of university) being pretty much too depressed to leave my room.

So, should I ask her out?

POST: Nothing really serious. He thinks he's being playful by hitting, punching, slapping, pinching and twisting my skin. But sometimes it really hurts. He has a really bad habit of twisting my nipples all the time and it gets to a point where it hurts all day. If I ask him to stop he just moves on to other parts of my body. 

Like today he punched my stomach several times (like pretty hard punch) and then pinched my stomach. I am still getting stinging pains on my stomach skin every couple mins from that pinch. How do I get him to stop?

POST: The title is pretty self explanatory. We have been together for about 18 months now and I am damn near losing my mind. He's a great guy and easily the best person I've ever dated, but his laugh makes me want to tear my hair out. It also doesn't help that he laughs after nearly everything he or anyone else says. It's the same every time, a short but extremely loud, ""ah-huh-huh-huh."" He literally sounds like a cartoon character. 

I don't want to tell him that his laugh is annoying, because you can't really control that very well and that's a hurtful thing to hear, but at the same time I am afraid I'll accidentally rage strangle him next time someone tells a joke.

POST: Original post: 

I really did read all of your comments, and thank you. I was pretty upset and didn't do much responding. It was definitely trickle truth. Each time I pushed her, more stuff came out. It was definitely a longer term thing, definitely physical on more than one occasion. 

I told her she couldn't work with him, and she shouldn't want to if what she was saying was true. She agreed. She agreed to counseling. She also agreed to give me access to all of her texts, emails, phone, etc. in real time (there's an app for that) She wants to work things out - especially since we have two kids under 2. 

As for me, I have to figure out how to get past it, how to forgive, and how not to be a giant sucker. I think that last one may be the hardest. Any words of wisdom are definitely appreciated.

 My boyfriend and I have a fantastic relationship. We live together, are very open and communicative in our relationship and have a lot of fun together.

TITLE: Girl said yes to lunch date, but I don't think she has an actual interest?
POST: Me, whom is a 20 year old male figured I would take the shot of asking out my crush (18F) in a snapchat conversation. It went in the lines of this

""We have a lunchdate when I get home, just so you know""

- ""Haha 😊"" (embarassed smiling emoji)

""I take that as a yes?""

""- Absolutely ☺""

""Date it is then""

Whereas she stopped replying and I haven't had any reason to pursue any other conversation with her, just some minor that she kills by ceasing to reply despite the ends being loose to continue with if there was the desire to talk more. So I am confused, does she have an interest or am I wasting my time being toyed with despite her not being that type of girl? I am abroad now and discussing the specific lunchdate would across as weird momentarily but of course I will within a short future.

She really likes me too and there's an obvious attraction between us. 2. That she is not looking for anything serious right now. 3. That she thinks I should take her on dates.

POST: Hi guys,

I've been dating this girl for about 3 weeks now and we usually get along great and enjoy each others company. 

But last night, New Year's Eve, I met up with her and her mood took a rapid downward spiral. For 2 hours we sit and in silence with me having to pry each word out of her. I try to ask her what's the matter. I get a very passive-aggressive, ""nothing"" multiple times. 

Then we go to a New Years party. I figure the best thing to do is to leave her be with her friends. In the meantime, I consult her friend as to what might be wrong. They have no clue either. She is obviously upset and it's clearly visible. Over the night she warms up to me a little but I can see it was a show for her friends. As soon as we are a lone again she is right back to being cold.  

I haven't talked to her so far because I'm understandably upset over her abusive behavior.

What should I do now?

TITLE: Is It Bullshit?: Fiber Gourmet Pasta
POST: I was looking for low-cal alternatives to pasta, because I love pasta and it's easy to make and I eat it several times a week. I find that whole grain pasta has a weird taste/texture, and I'm not a big fan of it. 

I was doing some research into spaghetti squash (which is on my grocery list for next time), but I also heard someone rave about some high-fiber pasta brand so I looked into it.

What sorcery is this? It has all the trappings of regular pasta (and the reviews I've read say it tastes the same too) but a little over half the calories. My mind boggles over how much extra pasta I could eat! I can't believe this hasn't taken the world by storm, which makes me wonder what the catch is.

TITLE: NY - Issues with retirement tier, not sure if this is a legal question or not.
POST: Basically I joined the NYS retirement system in 2005 into tier 4, got a retirement number, packet, all that jazz. 

A few years ago they sent me a new packet for tier 5 with a new number, then another with tier 6. They won't recognize my tier 4 registration number and INSIST I am tier 6. 

I have called at least 7 times and written no less than 16 letters with documented proof, and nothing has changed. My paycheck is still listing tier 6 and taking money out of me. Under tier 4, after 10 years, you stop paying in. 

Do you know if a lawyer can write some strongly worded letters or take this to court? Is this even a court issue? What kind of lawyer would this be? I have just tried everything and feel so frustrated.  It is the difference of me paying thousands of dollars more and retiring 8 years later, with significantly less pension.

Here I go,
We have been in a relationship for 5 years, we've had our ups and downs. For the past year, we have pretty much fight almost daily. It's about the same shit, and he always starts it. I just want peace. It's really hard to deal with it considering we live together. We have no kids, and we're not engaged. 

I couldn't no longer stand his constant drama, so I shut myself off emotionally. 
Recently, he's realised what he's been doing for awhile. We go to couples therapy and trying to work things out.

I am afraid that this isn't salvageable. But I gave him an x amount of months to fix it, with me trying to make it work. I Judy don't want to be hurt again. It it's worth it? 

I need to know what you think reddit. Thank you

She was shouting at me always for no reason e.g dropping a pencil onto the floor during a test. But this was the last straw that broke the camels back. One day, I had a bleeding nose and went to get a tissue. She hit me with the cane for bleeding in class and I never got that tissue. Now I'm a waitress in a restaurant and Mrs Jackass steps in to order some Steak with Chips. I took down her order and went on to get this really old and musty steak. I asked the cook to cook it and he did. She was about eighty and recognised me after a few minutes. She gives me ""the stare"" as I hand over her food.

Reading the novel's introduction, it looks like this edition has about 500 extra pages. THAT IS CRAZINESS. The copy I have right now is 1054 pages. Holy crap, that much more got added -- wow.

TITLE: Separate or stay together during marriage counseling? M31, F27, married 2 years
POST: My wife and I have had our share of ups and downs for the past 2 years we've been married.  We recently ""separated"" for 11 days, and I just returned home.  We talked a lot, and agreed we have some real issues.  Primarily, she has trust issues with me.  Since I've been home (one night) things have been great between us, when we don't directly discuss our marriage.  Even our sex life has been on a totally new level.

We are going to go through marriage counseling weekly at least.  During that period, we are entertaining her moving out to a nearby apartment while I stay in the home.  We will still be married and committed to each other, just not living together.  Is this a normal thing to do?  Is this a good thing to do?  Or would that just be the start of the end?

Thanks in advance, everyone!

POST: Aside from the standard stuff I've seen around here, like drinking water or filling up on really dense/low calorie food, I've realized a method that works for me to avoid feeling hunger pangs.

I noticed that during the week, when I'm watching TV or browsing reddit, I tend to get hungrier more often. I just want to eat when I know I shouldn't. But on the weekends I eat less than I usually do and don't seem to get hungry. I still browse the internet and watch TV probably a similar amount, but it's when I have free time and when I also do something else: play videogames.

Something about focusing or getting entirely absorbed in a good game somehow gets me through a whole day, almost forgetting to eat. I've experienced the same thing when reading or writing something, anything that gets me to focus all of my attention on it.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

A few days ago he got super upset bc I didn't tell him I went on a date... It didn't go too great do I never said anything. Then recently he got mad bc I said I missed having sex.

TITLE: Relationship Redditors: Where is the line between romantic gesture and creepy stalking?
POST: Yesterday I Learned that I'm a creepy stalker: 

Getting away from my specific Forever Aloneness for a moment, I'm left wondering: where is the line between a romantic gesture and creepy stalking? I clearly lost track of it somewhere.

Here's a for-instance: lets say you break up with your S.O. and a few months later you decide you want them back. I see two groups:

- People who are just lonely and want to get back with anyone, and the ex starts looking better and better

- People who took a look at their actions, made some corrections, and want to try to patch things up

Say for the sake of argument that we're talking about the latter case, what can you do to reach out that's romantic but not creepy?

TITLE: Apartment dwellers of Reddit: Where do you store/air out your stinky hockey gear?
POST: My SO and I have had many conversations about moving in together. I bought my apartment 3 years ago (before we met) and have 2 years left on the mortgage term before I can move on and we can get a bigger place together. So for now, we'd be stuck sharing 730 square feet (which is downright luxurious for one person but somewhat cramped with two).

The issue that ends the discussion every time is his stinky hockey gear. He has goalie *and* player gear, so it's a double whammy in terms of storage space needed and stink produced. He currently lives in a man-cave of a basement suite and airs it out in his bathroom because, y'know, dudes don't need bathrooms to be clean and accessible. 

He plays one or two times a week and needs to air it out afterwards.

How do other couples in small spaces work around this issue?

POST: So, this person is exceptionally difficult. There are a bunch of annoying rules he's imposed post-me moving in, he's probably the stingiest person I've ever met, and he's decided that it's acceptable for the heat to be at 5ºC when no one's home, 10ºC when sleeping, and 15ºC when someone's home and awake (41, 50, and 59ºF, respectively) thus resulting in me being fucking freezing always. I checked the landlord tenant act, and it says it needs to be at least 20ºC (68ºF) from September through June. The most annoying part about it is that he goes about telling me the rules with a ""that's the way things are"" attitude, and like, I understand it's his house, but I'm paying rent, damnit. And a third of utilities.

When I told my family, my dad asked what it meant - so I explained it to the best of my abilities. 

He then said to me: Oh, so you're half retarded. 

I just laughed it off initially, but it actually hurt my feelings a lot. 

I have no idea what to do from here. I live with them so NC isn't really possible.

POST: Hi, so the title speaks for itself. Have you ever been dating a guy and kissed someone else? Why did you do it and what did it mean to you?

I (M22) recently started dating this girl (F22) we had been on a few dates and things were going well then she had to go out of town for a few weeks. We talked everyday while she was gone and then a few days ago she told me she had kissed another guy on her last day out of town. Before she left we had talked about how we both like each other and we don't want to see anyone else and she says she was drunk and immediately regretted it. I know I need to make a decision myself on what to do but I was just looking for some input from people who have been in a similar situation.

TITLE: Can I take HMRC to court for being late processing my return?
POST: It seems completely unreasonable to me that if I pay my VAT bill 12 hours late, I am fined almost 100% of the figure for doing so, yet I have just got my tax bill from 2009/10 (it was 40p!), nearly a year late and somehow it's OK for HMRC to just write a limp apology letter.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.

Though this time, I think I need some support if it's possible.

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off? For example, I know most males aren't supposed to eat fewer than 1500 calories a day, and when I do (or did, should I say) the weight loss just isn't as prominent (not to mention that at below this point, the body's chemicals start to unbalance).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

I plan on losing my weight by limiting myself to 2,000 calories and doing 8 5 minute workouts everyday. On my days off I plan on working on cardio but at work I thought, what the heck. Why not use the downtime to trim my belly.

All I could think about doing is push-ups and sit-ups. And trust me I dont want a lecture on why doing 100 push ups a day would be a bad idea, so help me mix it up a bit.

This group of friends go out for breakfast every Saturday Morning. It's become a tradition that we've come to look forward to. We go to the same delicious restaurant with fair prices, and the wait staff knows us all by name.

My ex and I continued to attend after the breakup. We looked past the awkwardness because the tradition had become so important (and fun!). But now a new obstacle has presented itself. He has acquired a new girlfriend who has no taste for my presence. Thus, he set an ultimatum for our friends circle: It's either him or me.

What do I do? Do I continue to go with my nose high, saying that he can stay home (since this is just childish)? Or do I put my pride to work, and step back so as to avoid any of this ridiculousness? Which option would make me more mature?

He allows me to continue to do this despite the fact that it makes him uncomfortable; citing the fact that he loves me and trusts me enough not to take it too far.

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

I have a dumbbell set, and some open space, and that's basically it. Can anyone suggest some exercises/routines of what I should be doing with my very very limited supply of weights? Again no room for a bench press and shit like that. 

What I'm looking for is links to videos on YouTube etc...where I can throw them up on my computer and do the exercise while they are doing the exercise in my room....that way I can't ""learn"" and do things properly in the comfort of my own house.

I also plan to continue 45-60 minute cardio 5-6 times/week (post-dumbbells). Any help is appreciated.

In the past when she's run out the door it's only been down an apartment building hallway - nowhere for her to run. But with the move, there are many places to go :(

Oh, and she IS microchipped, but I want the collar as a back-up so that people will know immediately that she belongs to someone and isn't just a stray.

POST: I've been dating this girl for about 3 months. She's had sex since the last time she was tested. I always use protection but I still asked her to get tested about a month and a half into being exclusive. She still hasn't done it. I've been tested after my last sexual relationship and I've even shown her the results.

She's in school still and a bit strapped for cash so I've even offered to pay. She's keeps saying she will go but keeps procrastinating. I know things are really hectic for her right now trying to find a new place to rent and finals to study for, but I feel like squeezing in a test isn't unreasonable.

I would rather not ask about her sexual past as I tend to get jealous and over think things when I hear about past experiences. So I figured she could just get the test and I could move on.

Furthermore, she didn't send ALL the gifts I gave to her, just, I guess, the ones she didn't want.

I went to a party a couple of nights ago and cheated on my girlfriend, whom I loved and still love very much. I told her, in person, the following day, what I did. She cried, and it was heartbreaking to watch, but I sat there and consoled her. I didn't try and make excuses for myself, I just told her what happened. We've decided to stay together, and she said that she still loves me. She obviously hasn't forgiven me yet, and I don't expect her to. This is where I need some assistance; I hate myself. I can't stop hating myself. I've started crying out of nowhere. I tried to cut myself with my watch immediately after I cheated. I'm starting to think that I need to break up with her, because I don't deserve her whatsoever, even though we both love each other. What should I do?

Anyways, I was playing soccer last Friday and I forgot to wear compression shorts and instead wore boxer briefs. We were out there for an extended period of time and I do not know whether it is from the sweat buildup or what but over the next two days (I played Ultimate Frisbee on Saturday and forgot my compression shorts AGAIN), I developed a rash on the inside of my thighs and my groin area, which causes it to itch like hell. Some of the skin seems to be peeling off and whatnot so I do not know if this is serious or not. I've tried looking up what it is possibly is and I am fairly certain it is either a ""sweat rash"" or ""jock itch"". So far I got myself some antifungal powder and have been using it to see if it goes away. Any ideas on if this is serious or not or if I should get it checked out?

So recently I've started to count my calories and am on the road to losing some weight, but I've got a few concerns. My main question is: why is that if you eat below a recommended amount of calories, your benefits drop off? For example, I know most males aren't supposed to eat fewer than 1500 calories a day, and when I do (or did, should I say) the weight loss just isn't as prominent (not to mention that at below this point, the body's chemicals start to unbalance).

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia.

POST: We meet at a camp during the summer. She wouldn't talk, look or even walk toward people because that's how bad of an introvert she was. Being an ex introvert I decided that I would try and help her come out of her shell.

I then realized that I really do have feelings for her like I actually liked her. I asked her out and she said yes. We have been together for a month now.

The problem started toward the 3 week mark of our relationship. She always says that other girls are so much prettier then her and she doesn't know why I'm with her and not these other girls because they're so much better then her.

What do I do to help her feel her self worth?

She responds with ""I'm at work pal.  I close, but it's nice to hear your off.  I hope your enjoying your day off.  I'm going back to work from lunch.""

TITLE: [20/f] Etiquette advice needed for breaking up with my semi-long-distance boyfriend [22/m]?
POST: Hey. 20F dating 22M for almost four months, and things just aren't really working out. I want to have feelings for him, but I don't.

Anyway, we're in a not-quite-long-distance relationship--he lives an hour away and drives to see me once a week. I know that generally when breaking up with someone you're supposed to do it face-to-face, but I feel like it would be unfair to make him drive all the way to see me only to be broken up with and have to drive back. Would a phone call be acceptable?

Also, if he asks why specifically I'm breaking up with him, how in depth should I go? I mean, there aren't any smoking guns or anything, I just... I don't miss him when he's not around, and I don't get excited to see him apart from the sex.

POST: So I've been talking to a girl (Eastern European)for about three months now and we're both 19. It's starting to get rather serious but before we started talking she warned me that her parents (father especially) would disapprove of her dating outside her ethnicity. She also said that she'd probably have to keep it (the relationship) a secret from her parents. It didn't really phase me at the time because of how early the stage of the ""relationship"" between the two of us was, how ever now it is really bugging me. I think the only thing preventing me from asking her out is the situation with her parents. I'm worried that if I do start dating her, I wouldn't want it to be a secret from her parents. But on the other hand I wouldn't know how to go about meeting them knowing that they would disapprove of me anyways.

To start off, the usual. Job A gave me an offer, I'd like to wait for Job B to offer. Job B still requires another interview at least.

The problem for me now is that Job B is much better than Job A. Job A is part time sales associate, Job B is full time in a different field I'd probably consider continuing. That makes Job B the ""dream job"", and I would definitely take it if offered.

Will a part time job even give me time to think about it? How do I ask them for that time without them just moving on with a different candidate. I also dont want to waste their time and mine by reneging.

POST: First post: 

My boyfriend and I had a very long talk discussing my concerns.  He promised me that there's no resentment building up and emphasized the fact that no one is forcing him to do these things.  I've been trying to compromise more often but he usually insists that we do what I want to do (i.e. picking a movie to watch that he doesn't like but knows I'd be interested in).  In all honesty, his behavior hasn't changed dramatically but he has begun to ask me for more favors, which I'm completely fine with doing.

I'm still not a little anxious about the prospect of us having a big fight but after reading everyone's comments I'm sure that any fight between us won't be as terrible as I've made it out to be.  He's a good guy and he's handled everything perfectly so far.

We have never had this problem before... Training him as a puppy was effortless.     
      
Now none of our methods are effective. No matter what we do, he finds a way to pee inside. Even if we watch him like a hawk in the room, he'll straight up pee in front of us.     
    
He is not neutered, and the vet has told us this is our only hope in terms of making the accidents go away. We aren't really comfortable with doing this to him now that he's older, so as it stands, it's our last resort.

I have also synced my Fitbit with MFP to track my steps, and I input my workouts too, but the question still exists: should I eat enough calories so MFP is satisfied and I've ""met my goal"" or should I continue just to eat 100-500 below my TDEE and exercise to burn more calories?

TITLE: Me [23 M] confused after going on a pretty good date.
POST: I recently went for a coffee with a girl I didn't really know, to get to know her and that. It went really good, she was talking more than me, and there were no awkward pauses or that, and it felt pretty good.

So, I was away to ask to meet her again in the future, but she did that before me and went for a hug. At this point, I was thinking that this is pretty damn great :D

But... it's been a while since then and I haven't heard back at all, and I had no reply to my text asking to meet up again. Situation has left me a little confused because she seemed interested, but I guess not really? Why say meet up again?

I've been thinking of saying that I had bad service and misheard what day she said to come in and say I thought it was Wednesday or that I had a family emergency and didn't have my phone all day.

TITLE: Me [18M] with my clingy Ex [18F] that lasted 1 month, just broke up a week ago. Don't know if break up was justified.
POST: We are both 18 and in college, and live in the same dorm complex (not the same rooms though). I broke up with her because I felt like we went WAY too fast and she had way too much emotional attachment (there was a point at which I didn't feel attracted to her even). I didn't feel like she would change her clingy-ness much at the time.

However, after a week of breakup, I've been reconsidering if she can change. Maybe it's just me missing her attention, or that I don't like being alone, but I'm now unsure if I overreacted about her emotional attachment and clingy-ness.

What do you think /r/relationships? Should I reconsider the breakup or stick with my decision?

POST: I'm navigating being primarily a contract worker, and my current contract is up on June 30, meaning I get to crawl back to Covered California for my health insurance for now. I'm expecting to actually use it (therapy and prescriptions and such), meaning I can't just do a Bronze or High Deductible, and I don't expect to be unemployed very long. I have an HSA account, and I've read that I can use HSA funds to pay my premium for Bronze or Silver level, but it's unclear if that works for Gold (no deductible). HSAs say that it needs to be a High-Deductible Plan, but also that if I'm unemployed I can use HSA funds to pay my premiums, and then I can get those taxes back (at least federally).

POST: My girlfriend and I met at the tail-end of college and everything was great. We fell in love, we were both happy and fought very little. Over the past 6 months, I've noticed our fights and unhappiness is coming more frequently. We both argue and constantly have to ask ""why are you mad?"" etc.

I know these are normal things in a relationship but when is it too much? She's depressed now about her day-to-day job and our sex life is not as passionate as it used to be. She almost never wants to do it anymore, and everytime we do, it's a chore for her. I find myself being annoyed by her over arbitrary things she'll say. 

How should I handle this situation? I love her so much but I don't know how to move my life forward. Is this something we can come out of and how will I know when if time to end it?

I work as an paramedic in a fairly small community and while talking to one of the nurses my relationship with my ex came up. I casually mentioned that we weren't seeing each other anymore and then got sent out on a call. 

The nurse (21-22f) (who I've know for about 6 months usually chat for 5-6 minutes at a time) almost immediately added me on Facebook and struck up a conversation. 

So my question is, am I reading to much into this? Or should I being asking this girl out for drinks or dinner?

POST: So I am in college and got my first ever girlfriend; I have hooked up with people before, also just in college, but never had a relationship.  

The weird part is I was so sure I wanted a relationship, but since we started dating suddenly I am not so sure.  I feel myself almost wanting other girls even more badly now (sort of a want-what-you-can't-have type of thing).  

I'm not sure if this is a normal reaction to a first relationship or maybe I thought I was more ready and mature then I actually am.  Any thoughts?

(We haven't had sex or done anything past 2nd base so could it be sexual frustration?)
