My mom makes good money, she's a surgeon and my dad's a well respected and busy lawyer. I got really heated & careless and said that I didn't ask to be born and maybe she should've been more responsible with birth control. She then said that she and my dad only got married because of me and I'm the reason for her failed marriage.

She recently reached out saying that she really misses me and wants to get back together. I'm not so sure though. I'm obviously devastated and of course I would love to give another try, but who knows if she would do it again sometime in the future? Why would I want to commit to someone who gave up on me to hook up with someone else for a while?

She then invited me, and I'm uncertain as to what this means... Is it a good sign, or bad?

My current level: standard run is a 10k at around 52:00 (fastest is a 48:00), longest run I've ever done is a half marathon (not in a race, just ran 13.1 mi on my own). So I'm an ok runner, but I still haven't crossed over into being truly serious about it.

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

A lot of people are aware of this happening, including the close friends of the guy who got cheated on, the guy still knows nothing about it. I feel like if I was the one to tell him it would obviously be detrimental to a relationship that's half a decade old, but unfortunately, also to the guy's relationship with all of his friends that chose to keep him in the dark this whole time.

By telling him I feel I'd be causing the guy unnecessary pain... But on the other hand, maybe I'm this guy's only chance to avoid him going down a long dark road which he may choose to avoid given he knows all the facts.

POST: About a month ago I filed a police report against my ex boyfriend [18m] for sexual assault. In this case it is considered rape because in the state of Hawaii, anything entering the body without permission is considered rape. The detective met with me and I had an interview in which I gave the details of what happened in December. (him fondling and looking at my breasts and him fingering me. Both without permission) when we broke up in January I had deleted all texts and fb messages from him. My mom just informed me that the detective called and it does not look good for me. The boy has all messages and the school at which it occurred has hired a private investigator. The detective said that the boy could easily get away with this, and I could get in trouble for false accusations. What should I do?

While friendly, she isn't flirty, responsive to my flirtations or has been warm towards me at all. My mom thinks it's because I missed an opportunity to meet her family (she mentioned that she wanted me to meet her family on a public holiday that passed while I was away a few weeks ago), is afraid I might leave, or I said something to hurt her. 

Of course she could have cold feet as it's a one month old relationship, but that's just me being negative.

That said, when I returned home, all of her toiletaries were gone from my bathroom. She had been looking after my cat for me while I was away, and it's a bit of a shock for me.

Okay, so I was in a relationship for 7 years (15-22) with someone. While we dated I put in all the effort, arranged fun dates and tried really hard to be the best gf I could be. He put in no effort and arranged no fun dates. I dated around with a few guys between 22-24, nothing longer than a few dates each. Now I'm with someone who I'm pretty serious about, dating 8 months now.

 In my first relationship I made it a pretty annual thing that we would go on an adventure tour. The only years we skipped were years I asked him to book the tour and he forgot until it was too late and they were sold out for the year. (it only runs June-August).

POST: Hey, guys.  I've had my phone now for over five years and while it has more than stood the test of time, I think it's time to move on.  I'm looking for a phone that is 3G, or whatever G is the most current nowadays and probably a touch-screen of some sort.

I'd like to stay away from buying an iPhone as I feel the second I get one, it will quickly be replaced by the newest version that comes with a slightly larger headphone jack or some bullshit, rendering mine useless.

I use AT&T and will not be switching providers, so please use this information in your advice.  Price is of no concern, so use your imagination.  Not your literal imagination, though, because it is very hard for AT&T to bill me on that.

I've come to reddit because, I can honestly say, this section of the internet has genuinely won me over for being so intelligent and insightful.  I love you.

TITLE: My boyfriend (25m) read my (22f) journal
POST: I keep a journal and although I'm not an avid writer, I do make note of the things that are a big deal imo, whether its good or bad. 

Important info: 
- been with current bf for 2.5 years
- cheated on bf with ex 2 years ago 
- I haven't completely forgiven myself for hurting bf

A couple of weeks ago I dreamt I was in McDonalds and my boyfriend was sitting at a table, and my ex talking to him. They both looked up, noticing I had walked in, and I walked out with my ex. 

My boyfriend, sometime since then and last night, read my journal. He's convinced I'm not over him and is considering breaking up with me. 

I completely understand that he has every right to break up with me or what have you, but I do love my bf and I want nothing more than for us to make it through this and continue until we're grey and saggy. How do we overcome this??

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

im very emotional and i know that but i think i do ok at giving her space, but then again, maybe not enough.

she on the other hand is not very emotional at all. she doesnt talk a ton about how she feels and keeps everything to herself mostly.

when we talk, sometimes ill go off on a rant about how i dont like what shes doing and how she doesnt talk to me and that i miss her..and i can tell, im starting to overreact at that point.

i need advice on how to be less clingy and be ok with space, if anyone could talk to me about this thatd be great.

i also have a big problem with anxiety because of when i was younger so maybe im letting that come out again which is bad. anyway, help is appreaciated.

TITLE: Concerns about Sertraline
POST: Hi, so I'm not sure if this has been posted before, but I visited a doctor a while back and she prescribed Sertraline for general anxiety and agoraphobia.  While I started the medication I experienced dry mouth,  which I was willing to sit with.   One day,  though,  I was getting out of the shower and became extremely confused, which really scared me so I stopped the medication. 

That was all before I started school.  Since this semester began I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety.   For a while I was handling that, until my grades started to fall.  After that I became unmotivated, lethargic,  and irritable.  

Now I'm debating going back on the meds because I've not been able to ""kick"" the depression.   My concern is that I might experience more of the side effects.  If I've already experience a few, does that mean I'll experience the others?

POST: I know a lot of folks hate the little guy, but the other day I was listening to a song he did with Kany West, a remix to Runaway Love. It was pretty interesting, and it got me thinking, what if this kids the next MJ? 

In all do honesty, his current music isn't what we're all fans of, but keep in mind, he's young. He can't sing about dramatic life experiences, breakups, or heart ache, because he hasn't experienced that yet. As he matures, so will his music, and once that's combined with his talents he has the potential to be outstanding. 

So what does Reddit think, could Justin Beiber, potentially be the next Michael Jackson?

She's an important person in my life that i dont want to lose but i dont know what else to do besides ignore her. She's also in 4 of my classes too so thats hard.

So stuff has gotten really serious these past few days. It would seem that my friend (whom i only see as a friend), asked me out, problem is that I don't see her in that way. I just said i'd get back to her on it and it's been 3 days since we last talked. Not a big problem? Well not quite...you see we have a tonne of mutual friends so if i fuck this up i may lose everything. So i need help on how to politely turn her down and stamping any future advancements.

TITLE: Dearest Nerds, please guide me on buying a totally sweet phone.  Thanks.
POST: Hey, guys.  I've had my phone now for over five years and while it has more than stood the test of time, I think it's time to move on.  I'm looking for a phone that is 3G, or whatever G is the most current nowadays and probably a touch-screen of some sort.

I'd like to stay away from buying an iPhone as I feel the second I get one, it will quickly be replaced by the newest version that comes with a slightly larger headphone jack or some bullshit, rendering mine useless.

I use AT&T and will not be switching providers, so please use this information in your advice.  Price is of no concern, so use your imagination.  Not your literal imagination, though, because it is very hard for AT&T to bill me on that.

I've come to reddit because, I can honestly say, this section of the internet has genuinely won me over for being so intelligent and insightful.  I love you.

TITLE: [21 F] made up fake boyfriend and brought him along to meet me [18 M]....
POST: So I asked this girl to study with me and she agreed. But when we got together, there was another guy there. I asked who he was and she said it was her boyfriend. I'm pretty sure they are not dating for reasons that I will not get into. But here is the question: did she make up a fake boyfriend so I wouldn't make a move? or does she want me to get out of her life and stop annoying her?

It is confusing because she is pretty friendly when we talked in class and stuff but I'm not sure if this is just to avoid being straight up rude. We're lab partners and we sit next to each other during class so it would be pretty awkward if she straight up shot me down. I don't mind just being friends with her but I would like to know what this means. Does a fake boyfriend simply mean shes not interested in me romantically? Or does she actually want me to piss off?
