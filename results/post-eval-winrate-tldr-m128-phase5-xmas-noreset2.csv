TITLE: [21/m] started seeing [21/f] when shes contacted by ex and is now confused about what to do
POST: so i started seeing a girl for about a month i met recently after she broke up with her ex who is a friend of mine. he was cool with the whole situation until he saw it started getting serious between me and the girl, at which point he contacted her asking for a second chance. the reason they broke up was because the guy was a complete toolbag and didnt know what he wanted  in the relationship, but now, magically he does. i tried being a good friend before i made a move on the girl, by asking his permission before going for the girl and yet here we are. shes now confused about what to do, and so am i. What do i do to show her that going back to him will just end up being the same stupid things as before, without being an obsessive douchebag?

POST: Pretty much what the title says. A large charitable organization damaged the door of another apartment on the first floor while they were moving a dresser that we donated.

We notified the office manager after the movers left, as they didn't tell us about it. The manager was very nice and said he would document the incident and get back to us on Monday. The apartment manager is claiming that we are liable for the property damage, and need to get reimbursed by the charity on our own time.

We're moving out in a few weeks. What's the right approach here? Is it up to the apartment manager to work with the charity that did the damage directly? Or are they correct that we need to pay for the damage and then seek reimbursement?

TITLE: Am I being shallow Reddit? How should I proceed?
POST: A few months ago I met this amazing girl who is probably the coolest person I know, we have a painful amount of things in common and she has one of the greatest personalities I've ever come across!

So this girl has a great personality, an amazing sense of humor, an extremely cute face, and a huge passion for what she does. 

As much as I want to be in a relationship with her I can't shake this feeling... She is really underweight (not anorexic, I've seen her eat, she just has a stupidly fast metabolism) and as a result she is really lacking in the breasts department. I just have the worst feeling that her body might not do it for me sexually, which would end badly.

We've gone on dates and done the kissing and such and I really feel like loo bought be leading her on. 

So what's the verdict Reddit? Am I to shallow? Should loo go for it? forget about it? Give me your
opinions!

We have been in a relationship for 5 years, we've had our ups and downs. For the past year, we have pretty much fight almost daily. It's about the same shit, and he always starts it.

I couldn't no longer stand his constant drama, so I shut myself off emotionally.

POST: Anything from crazy nights to hospital visits to waking up in three towns over. I'll start: 

This happened my freshmen year (2years ago) of college. I stayed in one night to catch up on some homework/study while my roommate and some of his friends were going out drinking. 2 hours later I get a knock on my door. It was his two friends. Apparently my roommate decided to steal someone's drink which unbeknownst to him it was drugged with something. Me and his two friends were now tasked with bringing 200lbs of dead weight up stairs to the third floor in a building with no elevator without catching any attention. The night ended with him on the floor of the second floor stair case posted up with a book open and a pair of sunglasses on until the morning.

Today she texts me how she enjoys hooking up with random guys even tho being in a relationship, because she gets a kick out of the attention.

Even tho it's none of my business because I dont give a fuck about her, I get really disgusted by this behavior towards her boyfriend who for sure doesnt know about this.

Again, its none of my business, but I'm thinking about sending her boyfriend a anonymous message via facebook, because I honestly feel bad for the guy.

I need your advice Reddit, should I keep myself out of this or tell the dude about what she said to me?

POST: My ex and I have been apart from a few months now and she's seeing someone new.

She wants to talk to me again and she feels like everything is okay between us.  I'm a little put off because she left without a reason, has never tried to make amends and now wants to be friends.

I'm just not content with dropping all hope of an explanation and just being friends.  But do I even bother at this point?  I guess the logical thing would to be happy for her and keep my nose out of it.  If she wants to talk I guess I could call her up, give her the update and just be friends, as much as I can.

But even though all that makes sense, am I wrong to still a bit upset over it?  I don't know that I want to hear about how amazing her new boyfriend is.  I don't really have anything to say to her.

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

So I told her after I left her place, and from what I know, if girls aren't interested they will usually tell you right away, and let you down easy, or just completely destroy you, neither has happened.

She just hasn't replied, at all, nothing, I let her know roughly 24 hours ago and still nothing, so anyone got any idea to what might be going on? The only thing I can think of is that shes just consolidating herself about what to do next, like choosing what guy, but that's just me being stupidly hopeful.

Any idea?

I got a text from a friend recently and he was informing of a problem. 

He is a U.S. citizen but is originally from a country in Central America. His family is still in Central America and lived a quiet life until they were recently extorted for several thousand dollars. This country is much more corrupt than the U.S. so they don't want to talk to the police - it is likely the police are connected to the local mafia. 

At this point he wants to get his sister (also a US citizen but living in central america), mother, and father out of the country.

He currently lives in the Chicago Area. Any help or advice is appreciated.

I only do cardio. Always scared of the weights, don't know how to do them, don't/can't get a gym membership. I now will try weights, and this is where you come in.

I have a dumbbell set, and some open space, and that's basically it. Can anyone suggest some exercises/routines of what I should be doing with my very very limited supply of weights? Again no room for a bench press and shit like that. 

What I'm looking for is links to videos on YouTube etc...where I can throw them up on my computer and do the exercise while they are doing the exercise in my room....that way I can't ""learn"" and do things properly in the comfort of my own house.

I also plan to continue 45-60 minute cardio 5-6 times/week (post-dumbbells). Any help is appreciated.

POST: Hi Everyone!

Me and Fiance are getting married in October and we are currently looking for places to rent. My mom has an apartment opening up downstairs (no shared entry way) which would be about 350/ month cheaper than other places in the area. My fiance and her friends tend to think this is unhealthy. My mom is pretty cool and not hovering at all, so I dont think it would be much of a problem but i wanted some opinions. Do you think it is worth it to save the money or should we really try to avoid it?

Thanks!
