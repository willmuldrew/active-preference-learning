My exgf cheated on me over the holidays and I kicked her out and told her not to contact me. We haven't had contact since this happened. When we started dating she told me she was forced to give up her horse and would like to know if she is still alive. Every time anything that has to do with a horse she gets emotional.  Being the nice bf I am, I started to look for her horse. fast forward to yesterday: I received an email asking if this was the horse I was looking for.

POST: Ok so I have been ""dating"" this girl L for about 3 weeks. We have been hanging out we went to see a dance recital watched movies and just general hanging out stuff. However I have no idea what i'm doing and thus i'm not sure if this is actually a relationship. Or how to make it an official one without being insanely awkward.

Why can't I tell? 

To summarize last year she got asked to prom with some guy she barley knew so we ended up hanging out at after prom then hanging out and wandering the town until 3AM. During this time I had opened up about my depression(I had burns on my arms) which stemmed largely in part about me being confused about my sexuality.

So now i'm wondering if all this hanging out just makes me her ""gay friend"" or if we are unofficially dating, And what I should do in either situation?

POST: I know the Nazis were terrible and all but how do they compare to other occupying military's through history? Sometimes I feel like we have been encouraged to hate them for obvious reasons. But at the same time I wonder how brutal they are compared to other regimes.

I think to fairly compare them we should only look at the 'normal soldiers.' From what I heard the SS is mostly responsible for carrying out the Holocaust. Yet in movies and pop culture it seems like regardless of what kind of infantry/soldier/position the German guy is in he's always raping and pillaging.

now my problem is; while she was away on vacation, she posted a lot of pictures with this one guy... nothing that made it so obvious that they are dating but enough for me to question whether or not i should be asking her to dinner. i feel like maybe she will think its dinner as friends? although im clearly trying to ask her out on a date to get to know eachother... but if she has a boyfriend i feel like i would just end up looking stupid. what do i do? do i back off or ask her to dinner and during the dinner ask if shes seeing someone..?

Even though i broke up with her, I never stopped missing her. I tried a few times after to reconcile with her but it went nowhere. I talked to her recently and she was responsive.

POST: I (M17) am in a relationship with my GF (F17). We have been dating for 2 years. Over time her emtional and mental issues have become more apparent. She has horrible self confidence issues, horrible mother/daughter relationship, and lots of other Type-A depression symptoms. Obviously this puts stress on me. I try to make her happy, tell her she beautiful, everything you can do. And none of it helps. She is very unloving and self centered concerning her own issues.

POST: I have been kind of stuck lately, and it's my own fault. I was going slightly over my calorie goal each day, more and more, little by little, and my weightloss slowed to a crawl. I was losing a few ounces at each weigh in and I knew I could do better. I go to the gym every day, aside from sunday, and wear a fit bit which tells me what I have achieved and what I can still do food wise. So, while eating over my goal didn't hurt me, per say, it did throw me off the wagon a bit mentally. But this morning I weighed in at a whole pound down! I am slowly fighting my old habits trying to rear their ugly heads and maintaining my weight loss, and still losing. It's been so long since I saw real change on the scale, this sort of renewed my conviction for self control and good diet.

So when we got together after the Christmas break, things were sort of stilted and awkward. I figured something was up, so I didn't make any sort of advances and when she left after last weekend, things got even more distant. By weeks end, I asked her to talk about it and she admitted that she perhaps wasn't as ready for a relationship as she had professed.

That's fine, it is what it is... but now I'm having a bit of a rollercoaster trying to figure out how to rebottle the genie after having a conduit for the feelings I had for her. That said, she's one of the best friends I've had or could ever hope to have and to her, the friendship is ironclad... so if anyone has any thoughts on how I can quash the neuroses and get back into that stride, I'd appreciate it.

After I had found out that we both had a crush each other, it got really awkward. I didn't really know how to ask her out, because I honestly was a very awkward teenager back then. 

I still have feelings for her for a friend of even further than that, but my main problem is I don't know how to talk to her. When we both talk to each other, its about a 30 seconds conversation in class about homework or something small like that. Whenever I always talk to her she tries to avoid eye contact too. She still laughs at my jokes and whatnot, but we simply can't talk to each other. Any help?

TITLE: What are some subtle but effective ways to gain positive attention from shy men?
POST: I have tried the obvious: eye contact, coy smile, dressing nicely. I make jokes and laugh at jokes. I am female and not unattractive. I'm confident sometimes but shy and tastefully flirtatious for the most part. Truthfully, I get plenty of attention from men at parties and social gatherings. But of course the one guy who I have an interest in doesn't respond to anything I do. 

This guy is sort of shy, and I think he enjoys the eye contact and half smiles we send each other, but I want to take it further without seeming too forward. In other words, I want to flirt enough to provoke him to make a move. 

So what should I try, Reddit? I am not a slut, and getting him drunk won't work (we have been drunk together before... didn't help). I prefer to be reserved and playful... but how do you get men to notice that?

I am a programmer from the DC area.  My wife is going to start grad school next Fall, so we will be packing up and moving to LA at the end of this summer (August/September... about 6 months from now).

I'm afraid that my inability to start the job until the end of this coming Summer will disqualify me from most jobs currently available.

Do I apply for jobs now or wait (if so, how long)?  On one hand, I want to start applying now so I can have a job secured before I get out there.  On the other hand, I don't want to disqualify myself by applying to positions too soon.

Most people on r/relationships advocate not getting back together with exes as they are exes for a reason. So how are long term relationships supposed to work? How do people stay together for so long? I feel as though there is such a fine line to having a relationship that lasts a lifetime especially in today's society.

So my mother as been dating an ex drogue addicted (seems clean, dough he smokes some joints every now and then.)

She breaked up with him and he became very stalker-ish and calling all the time and sending sms's all day.

Some months have passed and now my sister says that they are together again, and that he is very possessive and keeps calling all the time to know were she is and with who, and in a very aggressive manner.

My mother wont listen to anyone that says that he is a dangerous person and that she should dump him for good. She keeps saying that he only turn against him-self (threat to kill him self, etc...), and not against other people.

POST: So I have a fear of commitment when I enter into relationships. This is the main reason none of them have worked out. Last night I was laying in bed thinking and I think I know where it stems from.

I feel that my fear of commitment is more deeply rooted by my fear of failure. I fear giving 100% of myself to something, only to have the possibility of failure (rejection). If I don't commit 100% to the relationship, it is much easier for me to move on if there is a break up (there always is). 

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

What do you guys think? Is this fear of failure a common occurrence? Does it lead to fear of commitment? Personal stories are welcome! How did you get over it? etc...

I've been under an incredible amount of stress lately and I had a meltdown.  I ended up punching a dumpster and couldn't hold back my emotions.  I didn't hurt her in any physical way, but she's angry at me.

The basis for her anger is that I ""don't have good coping skills.""

on average, i'd say I have 1 or 2 big ""meltdowns"" a year and the rest of the time I am totally normal and she's told me repeatedly that I am ""the most patient person she knows.""

Am I allowed to freak out?  I know ""allowed"" isn't really the right word.  I don't channel any anger towards her when I'm under a lot of stress.  at least I don't think I do.

It hasn't hit me how I feel about it yet. I'm starting by looking objectively at the situation. I don't know anyone else who was adopted, so I don't have much experience with such a thing.

If you have any questions about my situation, feel free to ask. I just am not sure how much info is necessary, and my situation is relatively simple.

They were charging more than I paid from vaping me, but instant gratification and all that. We didn't realize this until we got home.

These dreams almost *always* involve me at least kissing, and sometimes banging, a dude who isn't my boyfriend. Sometimes it's someone I actually know, other times I've never seen him before. The dream always ends with me waking up in a moment of panic, thinking ""oh my gosh, what have I done?!"" until a few seconds later when it sinks in that it was just a dream and I didn't actually cheat on my perfect, wonderful boyfriend.

I don't understand where this is stemming from. I'm an incredibly faithful woman and I would never dream (well, figuratively I guess) of cheating on my boyfriend. I love him and he completely satisfies me sexually, although I only get to see him once a month or so because we're long distance.

POST: I have been with my bf for 10 years and he finally proposed! Long story short he turned into a different person and we broke up. 

We got back together and we were working through things but still arguing constantly. Then I messed up and although we never split we were pretty close to it.

Lots more arguing ensued and a lot of trying to score points on who hurt the other more started. I spoke to him a few days ago and said we couldn't do that to each other anymore and that we had to move past it and not cast things up anymore. He agreed and said he wants to be with me and wants to make it work.

There in lies my problem. I spent the last 10 years building a life and a future with him and then it was gone. I do not feel secure just now and he says he wants to be with me. I want more than anything to believe him but I keep getting paranoid.

We have been in a relationship for 5 years, we've had our ups and downs. For the past year, we have pretty much fight almost daily. It's about the same shit, and he always starts it. I just want peace. It's really hard to deal with it considering we live together. We have no kids, and we're not engaged. 

I couldn't no longer stand his constant drama, so I shut myself off emotionally. 
Recently, he's realised what he's been doing for awhile. We go to couples therapy and trying to work things out.

I am afraid that this isn't salvageable. But I gave him an x amount of months to fix it, with me trying to make it work. I Judy don't want to be hurt again. It it's worth it? 

I need to know what you think reddit. Thank you

TITLE: Question about returning back to university.
POST: Signed up a few weeks ago. This is my first post. 

I (F23) attended a university for 4 years, yet never graduated. Mental, emotional, and physical stress towards the end of my senior year caused me to not return to classes. I never officially withdrew from the university, just never signed up for next semester. I proceeded to pretend I was a university graduate, but without a piece of paper to back me up.  

Am wondering if any other people are in the same boat as I am; I'm feeling really lost and hopeless. I want to return and finish what I started and worked so hard for, yet came up short. I feel like I'm being left behind while all my other friends are getting well paid jobs. Feeling like a poser.

My parents are around all week to look after a dog, but they work full days and are probably not going to be home for at least 6 hours a day at a time. I am willing to devote a lot of time on the weekend for training, but again I will only be there for a couple of days on the weekend. We are looking for a well behaved and affectionate dog that is athletic. We have had labs in the past, but we were also looking into Golden Retrievers, but I am concerned about it not getting enough attention. Thanks for the help.

POST: This woman (lets call her mary) that I am involved with has a 3yo daughter with another man. they have been over for 2 years now. Lately she has been telling me he has been angrily messaging her saying she's trying to keep his daughter away from him. After hearing her side and reviewing the situation in my mind I agree that my girlfriend is in the wrong.

I asked her if she has any reason to believe he would harm the child she said ""No."" Then I told her that she has no right to keep her from him. Should I be worried about this behavior? Has she really moved on? Should I run now? Is this a sign that she is not as over him as she would like to believe? Am I overreacting? Could this be a sign of her true character?

POST: I would like to hear your success stories. Here is mine. 

When I was in college attending a hockey game, I walked by the 50/50 raffle booth. I had always thought of entering, but as a poor college student a dollar was worth more at McDonalds than the odds were of winning. 

However, this time as I walked by I thought, what the hell, and dropped in two dollars. This was around Christmas time, so I was pretty poor. 

During the hockey game they announced the winner, and I ended up being the lucky draw.

I won somewhere around 160$.

It was enough to buy a few Christmast presents that I wasn't able to afford prior to winning.

TITLE: Why do I [22f] keep dreaming about cheating on my boyfriend [24m]?
POST: For the past month or so, I have been having vivid dreams nearly every single night. These dreams almost *always* involve me at least kissing, and sometimes banging, a dude who isn't my boyfriend. Sometimes it's someone I actually know, other times I've never seen him before. The dream always ends with me waking up in a moment of panic, thinking ""oh my gosh, what have I done?!"" until a few seconds later when it sinks in that it was just a dream and I didn't actually cheat on my perfect, wonderful boyfriend.

I don't understand where this is stemming from. I'm an incredibly faithful woman and I would never dream (well, figuratively I guess) of cheating on my boyfriend. I love him and he completely satisfies me sexually, although I only get to see him once a month or so because we're long distance.

Any idea why this might be going on?

I'm not proud of it, the only positive of the situation is that we didn't kiss/have sex, we just chatted and then crashed out fully clothed in her bed. 

I feel really guilty now, as I'd obviously hate if she did the same to me, and have no idea what to believe if she confessed a similar incident to me. Nobody knows that we went back to her place together, as we live in the same area. If she asks, should I tell her the truth?

It's all been fun and whatnot, but we were pretty cautious about calling ourselves a couple, both had some previous stuff mess up our heads. We've had a crush on each other since october, but started really acting on things ~2 months ago. Now, it has steadily evolved and we seem perfectly fine and happy and all that jazz, but recently I've been feeling that something's not right. Everything is seemingly perfectly fine, but for some reason I get the idea stuck in my head she's not as involved as she usually would. I wouldn't want to seem like I'm trying too hard or am too invasive too, which makes me unsure how to act. I have a history of overthinking and worry I might just be paranoid, which will lead me to trying too hard or something.

Any advice Redditors? I REALLY wouldn't want this one to go well.
