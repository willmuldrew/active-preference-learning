TITLE: Having a bit of a car problem, not sure if this is the best place
POST: I have a 2008 Nissan Versa with a keyless ignition that is stuck and will not go into the ""Lock"" position. Because of this, anyone who wants to steal my car wouldn't need a key and would just have to get the door open. The car thinks the key is present at all times, so I have to use the manual key to lock the doors when I get out and a little ""Hey jackass, you left your keys in the car."" alarm goes off for about 10 seconds. I was wondering if anyone has encountered this before or might be able to give me a heads up on the cost to repair something like this. If this is the wrong subreddit, please point me in the right direction. Thank you.

POST: Context: I wanted to drink a nice cool beer, but I noticed that my all my alcohol was sitting in the middle of the living room. Naturally, I wanted to quickly chill my beer (for immediate consumption) so I threw a couple bottles in the freezer, and a couple more in the fridge. Well, I managed to forget about the two freezer bottles for a while, but when I took them out, they were thankfully unfrozen. I mean, these beers were confirmed for liquid tier. Anywho, I crack open one bottle, and as I pour it into my glass (and it poured just like any other beer would; it was not frozen in any sense of the word), it began to pile onto itself, and slowly turned into a beer slurpee. It had the exact texture of any slushy I've consumed previously. Can anyone explain what happened?

I've been officially dating my girlfriend for almost three months. Before this we were hooking up for about a month before we put a title on it. I've dated before, but never have had a relationship as serious as this. This is my first ""serious"" relationship, and i'm not trying to rush anything. This girl just continues to blow my mind.

TITLE: I [M/22] think figured out why I have a fear of commitment last night, and I want to know if its a reasonable diagnosis!
POST: So I have a fear of commitment when I enter into relationships. This is the main reason none of them have worked out. Last night I was laying in bed thinking and I think I know where it stems from.

I feel that my fear of commitment is more deeply rooted by my fear of failure. I fear giving 100% of myself to something, only to have the possibility of failure (rejection). If I don't commit 100% to the relationship, it is much easier for me to move on if there is a break up (there always is). 

I feel I can relate this to many parts of my life. I don't ever give 100%, because I am scared that if I fail, it really just means'my best isn't good enough'.

What do you guys think? Is this fear of failure a common occurrence? Does it lead to fear of commitment? Personal stories are welcome! How did you get over it? etc...

I've been talking to this girl for roughly two weeks now and we've gone on a handful of dates. If I had to describe the feeling, I'd say it's overwhelming. Overwhelming because I've never clicked/felt this strongly about anyone before and it's scary in a way.

If we're being honest, I feel like she is the one. But that's a conversation for another day.

Anyways, it's obvious we are both very into each other. She has sent me sweet texts saying how much she can't wait to see me again in between dates and we are both very comfortable with each other.

Now, since I like her so much and everything is going so well right now, my biggest fear is messing things up. Obviously I want to be official and have a real relationship with her, but I don't want to ""move too fast"" or rush things if that makes sense.

POST: Hey Reddit, Ive got a questions about the best way to express feelings to a good friend of mine.  

Basically my friend [F26] is recently single, Ive known her for four years and realized I had feelings for her about 6 months ago.  I haven't expressed much interest as she has been with someone and I wanted to respect that.  Now that shes single I would like to at least let her know that I have some feelings for her (I missed my chance before she began dating her latest BF).  I may loose her as a friend but if I dont tell her I feel that Ill regret it. 

I'm not a shy person, and I'm not socially awkward, I just have trouble letting my feelings known (its caused some regret in the past).  So my question is this, for those that have been in this situation before how do you recommend doing it?

TITLE: I'm [21M] thinking of visiting my ex-girlfriend [24F], just as a friend
POST: We were really good friends before we went out, then we went out for about a year. She broke up with me 6 months ago, and I haven't seen her since, although we still chat from time to time on Facebook.

Anyway, she lives in a different city to me, which I'm going to next week, and I reckon I'm going to stop by and say hello to her and her family. She's definitely over me, so there's no danger on that front. It took me a month or two of no contact and spending time with other people, but now we have fun chatting like we used to, and I don't think of her that way anymore either.

Since I have less experience of breakups and relationships than some of the people on here, just wondered if this is a bad idea. I should add that she responded positively when I mentioned the idea to her.

TITLE: Anyone have suggestions for HIGH heels that won't kill my feet?
POST: My fiance is a full foot taller than me (I'm 5'4"" and he's 6'4"") and I hate the idea of being that short compared to him on our wedding day. I wear heels quite often and want to on the day we get married but, like any reasonable human, don't want to be completely uncomfortable. I can usually wear 4-6 inch heels for a few hours and 2-4 inch heels all day, but I'm hoping to find some 4-6 inch heels for the big day so we can be closer in height (plus it gives an incredible slimming effect when in high heels and a long dress). 

I'm willing to compromise and find super tall heels for the ceremony and switch to slightly lower more comfortable ones for the reception, but obviously they can't be too big of a difference in height because the dress will be too long. I've been looking at [these] on amazon (in gold) but don't have any other ideas.

Yesterday my girlfriend went out and got blackout drunk the other night, kissed her gay male friend. One of her friends had a go at her for doing this as she didn't realise he was gay.

My girlfriend then calls me drunkenly afterwards. Crying, saying that she's sorry she kissed him.

The day after I've confronted her about it and she's obviously very very sorry. Has text her friends to find out if anything else happened and relayed that to me.

I feel like this shouldn't be a big deal but at the same time it is... she kissed someone other than me, whilst drunk.

Whilst she's obviously sorry and I love her to bits. I dunno what to do or if I'm being silly for being hurt over this?

POST: We've been dating for 5 years and a half. My mom died 6 months ago and it's been harder than I can describe.

A few weeks ago, me and the fam were putting up lights on the house for the holidays. While on the roof, I was leaning over one of the highest parts of my house and trying to hang a line of lights on some trimming. Because of how the roof was designed and what not, I had to lean out quite a bit, and not being afraid of heights I was being way to careless in the whole process. As I leaned over, I sort of started to slide of head first, and at the last second was able to grab on to the ledge and work my way back up. It would have been a good 30 or so ft fall head first. First thing that went through my mind as it happened was, ""Oh shit, I'm fucked.""

I'm not sure if it's because the collar itself is too easily removable, or if it's because I'm not putting it on tight enough(?)...

She's indoors so it hasn't been a huge deal, but I'm moving to an apartment within a house this weekend, and because she's a ""door dasher"", I'm a little concerned she'll make a run for the yard. In the past when she's run out the door it's only been down an apartment building hallway - nowhere for her to run. But with the move, there are many places to go :(

POST: I don't say a lot even among friends. The only person I've felt comfortable engaging in enthusiastic conversation with is my brother.
I am a good listener and enjoy hearing what people have to say and I will answer questions just briefly. I tend to show friendliness through favors, helping out, paying for stuff without asking for money back, that sort of stuff.

However I'm not good at making new friends because I'm not a good conversationalist. And I've never even been on a date because I'm not good at talking to girls. I've been trying to get a date for the 2 years I've been in college and I haven't had a luck because it's against my nature to engage someone in conversation.

Do I have to change the way I am to meet people (hopefully girls) or is there some way to play to my strengths and weaknesses?

I told her on Monday that we needed to break up. She was surprised at first and understandably upset. I told her that we were just becoming two different people and that it would be better to end the relationship on a high note before we start to resent each other. 

She still wants to be friends, which I understand. I don't know if it will work out, but I told her that after a while of no contact we can reach out and see if we're ready to establish some kind of platonic relationship.

So I'm sad and newly-single. I've been going out drinking with a good buddy from work, and that has made me feel better.

TITLE: Should I pursue a relationship with a beautiful woman 6 years older than me?
POST: I (25/M) asked a beautiful girl (31/F) out whom I met at a bar last week and we had our first date last night. She seems like a wonderful person, and I am incredibly attracted to her. When I asked her out I thought she was about 23 or 24 since she looks really young, however, I found out last night that she is in fact 31 years old. While 31 is not old in the slightest, she is a bit older than I am, and since I've never been in this situation before, I'm feeling a bit confused. She is in the same place in life as me and is at my maturity level, thus I'm not thinking much about it. It doesn't seem to bother her as well, and she seems really into me. We're scheduled for another date tomorrow night.

Am I right to assume that 6 years is not a significant age gap?

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 I don't want to be a bad wife of course. 

I dress very conservatively in public so no one would ever see. I don't know what to do.  I don't want a tattoo. They scare me...it is just so forever and on your body. I know a husband is forever too, it just feels different for some reason. The name thing makes me feel like he owns me a bit, like I am property. I mentioned this to him, and he told me I am his property, but in a joking way. So everyone what do you think?

Although I only see him on the weekends (he has a curfew), he goes out of his way just to make me happy and does the sweetest gestures. 

Anyways, he's going to be stationed in Italy for 2 year within the next 3 weeks. He asked me to be his girlfriend but I'm not sure what to do. He's never had a real girl friend so I'm worried that he won't accept me for who I am but rather the idea of who I could be.

POST: Everyday I spend a minimum of 2 hours using public transport, with a minimum of 2 transfers from train/bus/subway.

Because of the size of the stations and going from bus to subway or subway to train, there is quite a distance to walk and I want to cover it quickly.

Now, I'm fairly tall compared to most people in this country and hence I walk with a large stride. I also walk quite quickly (much to my wife's annoyance haha).

But what irks me to the upmost is when these little people with their short legs cut me off and walk slowly in front of me, especially when talking loudly (they are like macaws here) to their friends or on the phone. So my petty revenge for these people is to either step, heavily, on the back/heel of their shoe or kick underneath their shoe so they take an extra large step.

The look of pain/surprise is amazing.

POST: My best friend recently started dating this girl. They are really good for each other and I'm glad he finally found an awesome girl. He is an awesome guy, and based on his ex (a monstrosity of a human being- a waste of intelligence if you ask me) he really deserves to have this girl. I'm good friends with the girl so even when I'm a third wheel I feel included. But here is where my problem is. 
Whenever I'm with him, he treats me like he always has. We joke, we kid, we argue different viewpoints of stupid crap- what friends usually do. 
But, when he is with her, he is CONSTANTLY putting me down, belittling me, and just trying to Make me feel inferior in every way. Im not sure what to make of this.

POST: I'm looking to pop the question to my girlfriend next month and have started looking around for rings. I really want this to be a surprise, so I haven't asked her anything.

She has installed Pinterest on my iPad so today I snooped on her and see she has a jewelry board - complete with wedding ring sets!

My question is do I just go ahead and get one she has pinned - there aren't many - or do I take those pictures to a jewelry store and get something in that vein?

We go on a trip in less than a month and will be celebrating our 1 year anniversary while on it. I'd love to pop the question on that day so I'm guessing time is running short.

Anyway, usually at the Check-Out the attendant would be beeping all the biscuits through etc, and even though they're friendly, you know they are quietly judging you. I always felt that way anyway, that could have just been my mental shame.

Today, I was at the check-out and the girl at the counter said 'You're so healthy with all this veg, you're putting me to shame, right before Christmas too!'. I felt so proud of myself.

TITLE: Short Frenulum question
POST: 18 year old virgin

when I was 16 I did a little research on the internet and discovered that I had phimosis. I stretched regularly and after a month I could retract the foreskin over the head when flaccid/erect. I then stopped masturbating for ~8 months and when I tried to masturbate again I realised that the skin had grown tighter again. I've started stretching again and I can comfortably retract the foreskin over the head, BUT any further and the frenulum turns a little white (the blood drains out) and the frenulum feels a little bit stretched.

TITLE: Am I the right person to do what I'm contemplating? [21]
POST: I'm in a bit of a dilemma.

It involves a guy[20] and a girl[20] I went to school with and have been going out together for 4-5 years. It's come to my attention that last year one of my closer mates slept with the girl a couple or so times.

A lot of people are aware of this happening, including the close friends of the guy who got cheated on, the guy still knows nothing about it. I feel like if I was the one to tell him it would obviously be detrimental to a relationship that's half a decade old, but unfortunately, also to the guy's relationship with all of his friends that chose to keep him in the dark this whole time.

By telling him I feel I'd be causing the guy unnecessary pain... But on the other hand, maybe I'm this guy's only chance to avoid him going down a long dark road which he may choose to avoid given he knows all the facts.

POST: I can't decide if I should try to be friends at all with my ex. 

We broke up in October after I left for college and he stayed home. 

Since then there hasn't really been a clean break (still have flirted and hooked up when i'm home) but he has told me several times, ""I've changed, I want to be single and do my own thing. I still care about you and there's still a special bond, just not romantic"" 

It hurts every time. But I don't really want a relationship either. I just don't want to let go of the past, so I'm afraid of really breaking things off (no contact style) and not seeing him over the summer (even though he would still live in a different town, just closer)

I just don't know if it's worth the stress or if it's what I really want. It kinda makes me sick to realize how much I think about it.

POST: So very recently I found out that the girl i liked also liked me back and we began dating immediately. I have no doubt that she really likes me and always tells me so. But i've been noticing that i've been starting on the conversations and asking to hang out.

We're both in highschool and very often i find that it is always me starting the conversation, me waiting for her after class so we can walk together, me who asks her to come hangout and go on dates. Of course she inititates conversation too but i just feel like i am doing it most of the time. It does not seem at all that she is annoyed by me doing the stuff mentioned above.

However, i can't shake the feeling that she wants a more ""distanced"" relationship and i am being overly clingy. Is this what i'm doing? Or do some girls just like it and prefer it when the guy does the stuff i mentioned above?

POST: My dad is going back to school. I'm a sophmore in college and he's barely going back. Every assignment he get he asks me to do for him or help him to the point where I end up doing it. He pays me and I do still live at home rent free. When I refuse to help him and tell him that he needs to learn for himself and that he is cheating himself in the end. He throws a thantrum and makes me feel like shit. Then he goes to my mom who has 2 jobs and has 5 classes. She does anything for him. 

He's acting like a baby and I don't know how to make him realize that he needs to do his work. I offer to tutor him and I truly try to teach him how to learn but he just does not want to do it. When things aren't done perfect, he threatens to quit school. Its so childish.

POST: I have tried the obvious: eye contact, coy smile, dressing nicely. I make jokes and laugh at jokes. I am female and not unattractive.

I'm not really in the position to be able to get an apartment on my own due to where I live, it would be far too expensive to do. However I do realize that might be a last-resort sort of deal, if need be.

POST: So I'm 24 and I'm talking to a woman who seems cool, we get on and share a lot in common. 
However she talks about how she gets bored in relationships easily and having her head turned also quite easily. 
Not cheating per se but lusts after other people I'm assuming. 
So she seems cool, but these traits aren't exactly attractive and I feel like it's going to just lead to a world of pain if I try to go forward with this woman. 

I have two questions, one is to people who do/did get bored of relationships easily, how did you overcome that if you even managed to?

The other question is to people who have dealt with someone with these issues before. How did you deal with them, did you manage to overcome them and have a succesful relationship? or should I not even bother? 

Thanks.

I don't mind that she hangs out with friends, and I know it's pretty early in the relationship, but am I wrong to be a little annoyed that she didn't respond until 24 hours after my first text?

POST: So basically me and my girlfriend broke up yesterday. I'm a recovering Benzo addict and recently got clean for my ex. I'm not sure how I'm going to stay clean while I go through this. Benzos take away all my worries in life and for those who don't know they come with deadly consequences, If you stop taking them the withdrawals can kill you(I had a seizure two weeks ago from the withdrawals). I Just don't know how to get through this without them.

Now my second question is do you think it would be detrimental to my recovery from this break up to go to a large outdoor dance party that I was going to go to with my ex? I already bought the ticket and I wanna go to meet some new girls but my worst fear is I'm going to see her there, what do you guys think?

Feral's kind of a strong word, but I think I'll stick with it. The weird thing is that we have a young daughter who is princess/frilly dress/heels/hair/makeup obsessed - and who has a better sense of style than her mom. Weird.

She takes little care of her hair - getting her to actually have some has been an issue. I'm thinking about brushing her hair every day both to show her its possible for it to look nice (it is really thick and lustrous) and because it seems a nice, intimate contact thing to do.

I'm also going to buy her some perfume that I like. She couldn't care less but is open to it.

But recently I've been worrying about the future. I've already lived abroad, studied a masters and lived by myself, but he hasnt'd done that yet, and I don't want him to lose the opportunity to do so.

Whenever I tell him that, he says that he doesn't matter for those things, and that cannot wait for us living together. I also worry that by when he wants to have babies I will no longer be able to do so.

It helps me a lot to read success stories about older women with a younger boyfriend or husband, gives me hope for the future

POST: Hey! Here is my story: I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend 4,5 years now. Last week I've met a girl (that also has a boyfriend), she talked to me at a party. I have not met here since then, but I will meet her tomorrow at another party. It is the final party of her exchange programm. Yep, she is an exchange student and will leave in 2 days...

But I kind of fell in love. I always think about her. Sometimes we are talking on facebook and she even said that I'm cute. (Don't know if that's much...)

Since I have a girlfriend for such a long time, I'm not really into these flirty things anymore tbh. What should I do, /r/relationships? **Tell her that I fell in love?** **Or is it better to not say anything?** I'm confused because I never thought I would meet someone that attracts me more than my girlfriend.

POST: We've been married 25 years with 4 kids. Our oldest daughter just got married, and we have a 12 year old and 16 year old at home. It was moving towards separation anyhow, but we were not to humiliate each other.

I just found out there has been 5000 texts back and forth with a semi-friend who is a guy. There have been other clues as well.

We have a significant amount saved and I own a home business. We are in a no-fault state in the US.

I no longer like her and have not for quite a while and do not want to spend my life with her. 

She's still in the house, but about to move out.

How do I handle the humiliation with our friends and community? Like they always say, ""The husband is the last to know"". I think a lot of people may know and it is extraordinarily embarrassing to think what they are talking about.

So when we got together after the Christmas break, things were sort of stilted and awkward. I figured something was up, so I didn't make any sort of advances and when she left after last weekend, things got even more distant. By weeks end, I asked her to talk about it and she admitted that she perhaps wasn't as ready for a relationship as she had professed.

That's fine, it is what it is... but now I'm having a bit of a rollercoaster trying to figure out how to rebottle the genie after having a conduit for the feelings I had for her.
