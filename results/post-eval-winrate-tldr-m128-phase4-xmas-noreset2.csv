TITLE: Me [19 M] have lied to my girlfriend [19 F] of two years about going to the gentlemens club once
POST: I went to a Genteens club with a few friends during university. I never told my girlfriend of two years I went. She had to find out from someone else. I know what I did is wrong and horrible. I don't deserve her. She has begun to loose my trust.

I just want to know if there's anyway things can change. If I can do something to make her trust me again. I just want a place to vent or if anyone has similar stories. Love is a hard thing.

TITLE: How to ask for more time to decide on a job offer?
POST: Sorry about asking this again. I read like 20 threads and 20 articles about this issue, but a lot of them were either not really answered, a different situation, or some combination of the two. I know this question in the most repetitive questions thread.

To start off, the usual. Job A gave me an offer, I'd like to wait for Job B to offer. Job B still requires another interview at least.

The problem for me now is that Job B is much better than Job A. Job A is part time sales associate, Job B is full time in a different field I'd probably consider continuing. That makes Job B the ""dream job"", and I would definitely take it if offered.

Will a part time job even give me time to think about it? How do I ask them for that time without them just moving on with a different candidate. I also dont want to waste their time and mine by reneging.

TITLE: Auto loan interest rate is way high, but i make enough to double down monthly payments
POST: So i bought a nice used car for 11.5k+ tax (2009 Accord coupe v6) And they gave me a high interest rate (7.19) for being a young male. I put 3k down so  I'm close to 9k left. my monthly for 48 months is $269 with Ally. I tried paying $100 extra a month but those con artists are not applying the whole amount to the principal! My first extra payment only 60 bucks went into the extra principal. the next like 80 went in. the rest is being applied to the finance charge.... I've called multiple times to tell them the WHOLE payment needs to be applied. they tell me because finance charge is calculated daily it gets taken out of my monthly payment. the rep told me to add my extra $100 to the monthly statement thats due near the end of the month. Is that good advice?

While friendly, she isn't flirty, responsive to my flirtations or has been warm towards me at all. My mom thinks it's because I missed an opportunity to meet her family (she mentioned that she wanted me to meet her family on a public holiday that passed while I was away a few weeks ago), is afraid I might leave, or I said something to hurt her. 

Of course she could have cold feet as it's a one month old relationship, but that's just me being negative.

That said, when I returned home, all of her toiletaries were gone from my bathroom. She had been looking after my cat for me while I was away, and it's a bit of a shock for me.

Our hot water heater is quite old (1977). It technically provides hot water, but not very much, especially in winter.

We figure that we can get about 10 gallons of hot water, plus 10 gallons of warm, before the heat drops to room temp.

We're curious about what the landlord is required to legally provide. My own googling just gives the general requirement of ""hot water,"" but I haven't found any info on minimum requirements for volume, or tank age.

We're willing to split the cost with the landlord for an upgrade, but want to make sure that they're covering their legal requirements first before we contribute funds towards a replacement.

TITLE: Can I train for a marathon with cross-training twice a week?
POST: I'm considering doing a marathon in April, but I'm wondering whether I can continue doing capoeira twice a week while I train. Here's my deal: Mondays and Fridays I do capoeira, and Sundays and every other Friday I do the hash (tamer European version though, so I can get away with just one post-run beer). I'm wondering whether only 4 runs a week (assuming I take a real rest day), one of which is the hash, could be enough for marathon training. That would give me one hash, one long run, and just two normal runs per week. That wouldn't even be 30mi at first.

My current level: standard run is a 10k at around 52:00 (fastest is a 48:00), longest run I've ever done is a half marathon (not in a race, just ran 13.1 mi on my own). So I'm an ok runner, but I still haven't crossed over into being truly serious about it.

TITLE: Finding Cosigners Outside of Family
POST: I'm not asking anyone here to cosign, I know that's against the rules, and it's not really what I'm gunning for. Here's my story:

I have not yet graduated from my school, but I haven't been enrolled for ~15 months. I will remain a student until I independently finish this one last requirement and get cleared for graduation.

My mom may need to move soon, and she'll need to get a mortgage on a new house. She's also the cosigner on my (private) student loans, totaling ~$123k. With that debt hanging over her, she and her wife can't get a mortgage.

Consolidating my loans is something I've been intending to do regardless. I want to do it to get the loans out of her name, but despite a decent salary ($60k), my debt-to-income ratio and credit score are too high to qualify independently for just about any options. What I really need is someone who can cosign a consolidation.

POST: I'll keep this short and sweet.

My ex of 3 years and I split up a while ago, and during the time apart I've never not thought about him or not missed him, even after I moved on and entered a new relationship. I'm happy with my current boyfriend, but a large part of me wants to get back with my ex (he very much wants us to have another chance, but not immediately; he wants us to keep focusing on improving ourselves and get back together when the time is 'right').

I'm not sure if I should 'give up' on that relationship and move on. I'm not sure if I even can.

TITLE: DAE grow up in a house where both parents were alcoholics? How did you cope? How are you doing now?
POST: When I was a kid (about 6), my parents would leave me and my older sister (9-10) home alone and go to the bar, only to return around 12-2am (sometimes 4am) drunk. I was afraid I wouldn't see them again some of the nights. I have no idea how I coped, but I guess I just eventually accepted the circumstances. My self-esteem was relatively low while growing up, and I can't say I'm very emotionally stable. I don't do drugs or drink regularly, but I used to go through jobs like candy until I learned to get my self stabilized. I feel I've come pretty far (got a steady job, at least), but I still occasionally have very self-destructive habits. I'm not sure how much of this (if any) is caused by my parents drinking habits. But I thought I'd see how other people that grew up in this situation are doing.

The timeliness and administrative discipline imposed on me through harsh financial penalties (we're a small business) should surely be reflected on those that impose it and we should all work to the same standards and regulations.

So can I take legal action against HMRC for their latency in processing my taxes?  I'm pretty used to court action from a parking fine hobby I used to have and I have also successfully taken 2 clients to court for non/late payment without any legal support for any of it.
