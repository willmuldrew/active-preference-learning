TITLE: My schoolmates have my underage pictures
POST: Context: I'm a 15 year old male from Singapore (I don't need specific legal advice, anything general will do). Recently, I took some shots of my body to keep track of my gym progress, some just shirtless and some in my undies. I uploaded them onto an account on Instagram which I thought I privatized and unlinked (my mistake). Apparently, one of my schoolmates screenshotted my pictures and has spread them around my school and it has now reached other schools. Is what he committed an offence? I may be planning to take action against him for bullying and possibly defamation. Any advice? Thank you in advance.

POST: Been dating a girl for about 5 months now. Things have been good, but she has been a little distant these past few weeks. Hanging out a few nights ago and see that she gets a text from an ex who she has talked down about a lot. The text is a little fishy, so i open up the thread and see that she has told him that she dreams about them hooking up. This has really been bothering me, but I am not sure if I am overreacting. I understand that you can't control your dreams, but admitting it to an ex who wants you back?? I am hesitant to talk to her about it because of the whole 'I went through your texts' conversation, and also I am not sure if this is as big of a deal as I am making it out to be in my head.

So, am i blowing this out of proportion? Should I talk to her about it? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

POST: My girlfriend is having a lot of emotional issues lately. She calls me nearly every night deeply upset, it usually takes me an hour or two to calm her down. She wants to seek medical help, meaning a therapist, or a counselor of some sort. Her parents have agreed sort of, but have taken no action. I am worried because it has gotten to the point to where she is severely depressed and thinks about hurting herself and throwing up sometimes because she doesnt feel good enough, she just as of a few months ago got over a eating disorder. I want to get her the help she needs but i obviously cant pay for it by myself. I dont know what i can do.

I've been dating a girl for the past 2 months which in my mind has surprisingly gone well, but I have yet to breach the question of what we actually are and what she thinks of me. I feel like I need to ask soon before I let myself actually fall to hard for this girl.

Some of my concerns are that she broke up with her EX in January and I'm kind of nervous to see if she's still attached and don't know how to comfortably breach the question. 

Additionally I've had to make all of the plans and always initiate texting, which sometimes takes her hours to respond to, and coming from an awkward guy this always gets me second guessing. Although this is true she does consistently agree to go out, but as insecure as I am I feel like she feels bad for me or something.

POST: I'm a fairly successful comic in my city's local scene. My best friend has been to a few shows recently, and decided that she's interested in performing at some upcoming open mic events.

She's been writing material and asking me to look at it for her and tell her if it's funny. To be blunt, it isn't. She doesn't seem to be particularly suited to writing comedy.

I've been trying to help her workshop, which she asked me to do, but I'm starting to think that there's not anything I can really do to help her make the material stronger. It's just not that good to begin with, and anything I can think to do to improve it just makes it sound like MY comedy, not something of her own.

What's the best way to tell her that I don't think she's cut out for this? I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I don't want her to end up embarrassed.

POST: so i started seeing a girl for about a month i met recently after she broke up with her ex who is a friend of mine. he was cool with the whole situation until he saw it started getting serious between me and the girl, at which point he contacted her asking for a second chance. the reason they broke up was because the guy was a complete toolbag and didnt know what he wanted  in the relationship, but now, magically he does. i tried being a good friend before i made a move on the girl, by asking his permission before going for the girl and yet here we are. shes now confused about what to do, and so am i. What do i do to show her that going back to him will just end up being the same stupid things as before, without being an obsessive douchebag?

I told my friend that I was going to go under 23 minutes this race and I did it. About 200 meters before the finish line someone who obviously seemed to want to pass me ran up to me and passed me slowly. I thought to myself that I would let it happen considering how tired I was. My teammates cheered me on and it's probably thanks to them that I ran as fast as I could and past him, getting a time of 22:59.

I have been with my GF for 7 months soon.

Both of us are dealing with things outside the relationship and letting it interfere with how we are around each other a lot as well but I feel like that's nothing new for a lot of couples.

TITLE: Me [24 M] not sure if I should pursue a [24F]
POST: So I'm 24 and I'm talking to a woman who seems cool, we get on and share a lot in common. 
However she talks about how she gets bored in relationships easily and having her head turned also quite easily. 
Not cheating per se but lusts after other people I'm assuming. 
So she seems cool, but these traits aren't exactly attractive and I feel like it's going to just lead to a world of pain if I try to go forward with this woman. 

I have two questions, one is to people who do/did get bored of relationships easily, how did you overcome that if you even managed to?

The other question is to people who have dealt with someone with these issues before. How did you deal with them, did you manage to overcome them and have a succesful relationship? or should I not even bother? 

Thanks.

My problem is that he's way too flirtatious in general and especially with me and my feelings keep getting stirred by it (as in everytime we flirt too much I'll start catching feelings for him and then start getting jealous of him, like he was my boyfriend). 

Bear in mind I really do love this guy and I know he loves me, we have a great friendship that I value over almost any other relationship in my life. But a lot of our interaction involves banter and teasing and I believe I'll ruin our relationship if I ever ask him explicitly to lay off the moves.

POST: So, I'm currently getting my grade 12 chemistry mark in summer school, which takes all of July. I was at a constant 81% all semester, but I recently did very poorly on one test. And just like that, with only one week left, it dropped to a 74%. Now, chemistry isn't my best subject, so I was ok with an 81. But this mark counts for university and I really need to get it done this summer. I have one more test, a huge assignment worth 15% of my mark, and an exam worth 15% of my mark. I need study tips! I don't have much time, so I'm going to have to cram. Do you think I can bring my mark back to where it was?

TITLE: Moving to LA from DC in August/September. When should I start applying for jobs?
POST: **Background:**

I am a programmer from the DC area.  My wife is going to start grad school next Fall, so we will be packing up and moving to LA at the end of this summer (August/September... about 6 months from now).

**Problem:**

I'm afraid that my inability to start the job until the end of this coming Summer will disqualify me from most jobs currently available.  I know a lot of companies hire college grads way in advance, but I don't know if companies will hire people this far in advance if they are already in the industry.

**Question:**

Do I apply for jobs now or wait (if so, how long)?  On one hand, I want to start applying now so I can have a job secured before I get out there.  On the other hand, I don't want to disqualify myself by applying to positions too soon.

I really need advice on this...

Why can't I tell? 

To summarize last year she got asked to prom with some guy she barley knew so we ended up hanging out at after prom then hanging out and wandering the town until 3AM. During this time I had opened up about my depression(I had burns on my arms) which stemmed largely in part about me being confused about my sexuality.

So now i'm wondering if all this hanging out just makes me her ""gay friend"" or if we are unofficially dating, And what I should do in either situation?

TITLE: F[22] 2 year on in relationship and very close to SO but sex is very lacking what do I do?
POST: My SO and I had a very active sex-life off the start of the relationship, which has slowly evolved into a compassionate relationship. You could say we act more like a married couple than a lustful fling. 

However, the more close and lovey we become the less sex has been a part of the picture. Weeks without any sex, but cuddling daily (sometimes hourly). Recently we had our first 'good' session in forever, and I actually laid there after he left to go play games and just stared into space. Nothing, I felt basically nothing and felt like we might as well have not even attempted anything cause at least then there'd be no disappointment.

What am I supposed to do in this situation? I love my SO very much, obviously we are close in every other way. But I am not even slightly satisfied sexually (even when we have sex).

TITLE: Why do I [22f] keep dreaming about cheating on my boyfriend [24m]?
POST: For the past month or so, I have been having vivid dreams nearly every single night. These dreams almost *always* involve me at least kissing, and sometimes banging, a dude who isn't my boyfriend. Sometimes it's someone I actually know, other times I've never seen him before. The dream always ends with me waking up in a moment of panic, thinking ""oh my gosh, what have I done?!"" until a few seconds later when it sinks in that it was just a dream and I didn't actually cheat on my perfect, wonderful boyfriend.

I don't understand where this is stemming from. I'm an incredibly faithful woman and I would never dream (well, figuratively I guess) of cheating on my boyfriend. I love him and he completely satisfies me sexually, although I only get to see him once a month or so because we're long distance.

Any idea why this might be going on?

POST: So I'm 24 and I'm talking to a woman who seems cool, we get on and share a lot in common.

Not cheating per se but lusts after other people I'm assuming. 
So she seems cool, but these traits aren't exactly attractive and I feel like it's going to just lead to a world of pain if I try to go forward with this woman. 

I have two questions, one is to people who do/did get bored of relationships easily, how did you overcome that if you even managed to?

The other question is to people who have dealt with someone with these issues before. How did you deal with them, did you manage to overcome them and have a succesful relationship? or should I not even bother?

TITLE: My chihuahua wont stop shitting in my apartment.
POST: Dear AskReddit,

   This problem has been going on for a while, and I decided I'd ask this fine community their opinion. 

   I own a chihuahua mix that wont stop shitting all over my apartment while I'm gone. Regardless of whether I spend an hour or 5 minutes outside with him before I leave for school, I can always expect to come home to little milk-duds strewn all over my apartment.

   I'd venture to say he has abandonment issues since I adopted him from a shelter. When I come home all he wants to do is sleep on my lap, and when I have to leave him with other people he whines the entire time I'm gone. So it's got to be a situation of nerves.

   How can I stop this behavior? I can't catch him in the act since he only does it when I'm gone. The shortest time I've been gone when it has happened is around 30 minutes. 

   Any suggestions would be appreciated.

We asked the complex to check the elevator shaft and they claimed to have looked 3 separate times with no sight of the dog. 

A week later, the following Monday another resident heard whining and there was the dog in the elevator shaft with less than a foot to live under. We told them they need to pay for the vet bill and they agreed and are now being difficult. The phone calls of them claiming they looked are recorded by the complex...what can we do?!

POST: I've had a problem since I started dating, I lose the interest in the other person as soon as I know how they feel about me. I can obsess over someone for months but when the other person gets close BOOM all the feelings disappear. 

I can't really believe they weren't true feelings in the first place because it' not just a matter of weeks, sometimes it can be years. And I don't get over it only by sleeping with the person, sometimes it's just a kiss or a declaration that makes it go away. 

So I'm tired of acting like a bitch, because yeah that's kind of the word that describes acting like you're madly in love and the next day forgetting the person. But really it's not deliberate. I'm really into the person and then intimacy shows up and I can't deal with it. I try not to show it but of course at some point it's obvious.

TITLE: A conflicted [28/F] with her [34/M] boyfriend of 1 year. When is it time to call it quits?
POST: I've been dating a guy for about a year now. Things are good between us for the majority of the time especially since we're both pleasant-natured, people-pleasing, and conflict-avoidant. But I don't know if it's RIGHT. I'm not sure if we're in love or if we're with each other because we're scared of being alone. 

I do enjoy the time I spend with him. But there have been problems with communication styles, our friend groups, our ways of dealing with conflict, and some other things (we disagree on things like recreational drug use). 

I'm not super young and being in grad school means its hard for me to get out and meet new people. But, I do want to be with someone who is a good fit for me and not just tread water in a relationship that won't go anywhere.

TITLE: How can I become a consistent planner and a hard-worker?
POST: I am a huge procrastinator and a half-ass-er (is that a word?).  I procrastinate on just about anything that requires the most minuscule amount of work, and always try to find the easy way out of everything (as in, if a task requires a lot of effort, I'll either half-ass-it, take an easier, more crappier route to doing it, or just give up).  

This has obviously negatively affected my life in a bunch of ways, and frankly, I'm tired of it.  Reading or watching motivating things has temporary effects, and failing to achieve something I aimed for will cause me to panic and actually try hard for a while until I rationalize the failure in my head and find comfort in landing on an inferior plane.

Do you guys know/use any methods in order to combat this problem?  Sorry if this is a repost.

It's beginning to be a problem since I really don't feel like I want to get to know anybody or make any friends or get close to anyone.

Background: Went out and had some drinks came back home, missed a step outside and fell ~5 steps landing on my knee (concrete). When I awoke the next day I did the best I could with what I had (beach house) to clean the injury.

That was 4 days ago, my scrape is healing pretty quickly, already about 30% smaller from the original wound, BUT since Day 1 I've been having this white-yellow discharge from the scrape. It produces at an accelerated rate when I shower, I try to place a paper towel over it and press lightly to lift some of it off. From what I gathered, it's not smelly, which means it's not infected. It is a little red around the outside, but I figured I'd check in with you guys to double check.

I would never leave someone over the fact that they have cancer. However, he does not talk to me very often. Sometimes, we go days without texting. Sometimes, we go weeks without seeing each other. He says he's always busy with friends or family, and it makes me feel like he doesn't want to see me. 

It makes me really sad to know that he has such a limited time, but he doesn't seem to want to spend it with me. That might be selfish, and I hate myself for being upset by this. 

I will always be there to support him, but I guess what I'm asking is if we'd make better friends?
